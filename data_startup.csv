"Paris-based Upway picks up over €23 million to make emobility accessible to everyone. Electric mobility is one of the fastest-growing trends across Europe. From the Nordics to the Mediterranean, more and more of us are now zooming around on environmentally friendly, electricity-fuelled forms of transport, bikes and scooters being two of the more popular and accessible choices. 

Aiming to bring the emobility revolution to everyone, Paris-based Upway runs a platform for the second-hand purchase, reconditioning and resale of electric bikes. The startup, founded in 2021, has just geared up its mission to become Europe’s leading provider with a fresh capital raise of over €23 million. 

The funding was led by Exor Seeds and Sequoia Capital with participation from Origins as well as existing investors Global Founders Capital, and key business angels in the mobility sector such as Henri Moissinac, CEO and co-founder of Dott and Moving Capital. It follows a €5 million raise in November 2021. 

Toussaint Wattinne, CEO and co-founder of Upway: “By backing Upway, our investors are confirming that the future of mobility is electric, sustainable and affordable. It demonstrates that our offer meets an increasingly strong demand from consumers who want to travel at a lower cost while limiting their carbon footprint. Upway’s mission is to accelerate the adoption of electric mobility at a time of massive awareness of environmental issues”.

The refurbished electric mobility market is on the rise, boosted by the expansion of bike lanes, restrictions on car traffic in cities, increased pressure on electronic waste and the booming circular economy. The electric bike market recorded a 28% increase in 2021 in France, representing nearly 60% of sales revenue in the total bike market (€1.3 billion). 

Today, nearly one in four bicycles sold in France is an electric bike – so there is huge market potential here. 

However, there are some sticking points – namely, high prices (€2,000 on average), a supply shortage leading to delivery delays (6-8 months) and, finally, concerns about the condition of the battery in second-hand models. This is what Upway founders, Toussaint Wattinne and Stéphane Ficaja wanted to tackle.

The Parisian startup is Europe’s pioneering platform dedicated to the reconditioning and resale of electric bikes. The company is helping to fuel a new eco-friendly way to travel across Europe though offering electric bikes by prestigious brands, refurbished in France by professional mechanics on 20 different checkpoints, sold up to 60% cheaper than first-hand bikes, and delivered to the client’s home in just a few days, and, covered by a one-year warranty.

Since the start of the year, Upway has grown its sales of electric bikes by 600%, doubled the size of its team and commenced its European expansion by launching in Belgium in March. However, they are just getting started and, with this new funding plan to launch in Germany, the Netherlands and the United States by the end of 2022. 

Blaise Matuidi, co-founder Origins Fund, said: “Investing in Upway was an obvious choice – sustainable mobility has become a priority. Making it accessible to as many people as possible contributes to the promotion of physical activity and the preservation of our environment. Supporting Upway in their global expansion has a particular significance for Origins’ athletes.”

Toussaint Wattinne added: “Having opened in Belgium with 500 refurbished e-bikes available for resale, we’ve had an amazing response as many Belgians care deeply about eco-responsibility. This rapid adoption is driving us to continue our expansion through Europe, and even across the Atlantic where we are seeing a tremendous increase in sales of e-bikes so much so that the US could be well on their way to catching up with Europe, which has been ahead of the curve.”",1
"Copenhagen’s Cogo acquires eScoot to become top shared mobility aggregator in Europe. Copenhagen-based Cogo has acquired eScoot, a leading shared mobility aggregator in Central Europe. Together, Cogo and eScoot have helped more than half a million users in over 100 countries find and compare shared electric scooters, bikes, cars and models in their city.

Launched in 2020, Cogo is one of the world’s most comprehensive price comparison tools for shared mobility, helping users check price, availability and travel times from multiple operators in just one simple search. In 2021, the startup picked up €1 million and has been growing from strength to strength as the European mobility sector has exploded. 

Also headquartered in Copenhagen, eScoot gathers shared electric vehicles for better urban mobility and greener cities, helping users find electric and human-powered vehicles in their city. The app compares prices from over 250 operators across the world.

With this acquisition of eScoot, Cogo expects an immediate boost to its expansion plans in key European markets such as Germany, France and the UK, accelerating user growth outside its current footholds in Southern Europe and the Nordics.

Robin Eriksson, Co-founder/CEO Cogo said: “We are thrilled to combine forces with eScoot. 2021 brought tremendous growth for our company. By joining our efforts, we are in an even stronger position to make an impact in this rapidly growing industry and to better promote the adoption of shared and environmentally-friendly transportation options for the masses.”

In a short period of time, the shared mobility market has skyrocketed across the world. Currently, the market is valued at approximately €35 billion, the industry is projected to exceed €440 billion in value by 2030. This acquisition by Cogo follows a period of rapid consolidation in the market where we’ve recently seen TIER acquire Wind Mobility Italy as well as nextbike and Ridango acquire LIT Transport. This new acquisition deal is one of the first amongst shared mobility aggregator platforms. 

Since its launch in 2020, the Cogo team have been developing a solution to the fragmented mobility market without an easy way to cross-check price and availability. Their efforts have so far paid off, as their app has experienced an over 40% monthly growth rate during the past year. Looking ahead, the company plans to add more cities, more mobility operators (currently 250), and more features in the coming year, such as in-app booking and payments.

Robin Eriksson, continues: “You shouldn’t have to fumble between 20 different apps just to book a ride or find a scooter. This is a slow and annoying process for the users as they just want to scan and go. Our vision is to take the friction out of shared mobility. By offering people a more seamless experience, we believe we can do just that.“",1
"Swiss startup Scewo develops power wheelchair to help people with mobility issues climb stairs. lobally, more than 20 million people report some kind of mobility difficulty each year. The mean age of individuals with minor, moderate, or major difficulty ranged from 59 to 67 years. However, this problem is not uncommon in young adults. People with mobility disability experience many transportation barriers, which hinders their participation in various events. Especially, a staircase is an insurmountable challenge for those who use a wheelchair.

At this juncture, using unexplored technology to great effect, the stair-climbing power wheelchair Scewo BRO has emerged as a savior for many, having won several notable design awards for its efficiency. It has already attracted a lot of users across Germany, Austria and Switzerland, among other nations. The founders of Scewo have brought this technologically sophisticated product to the market in just three years, demonstrating their outstanding talent.

From July-November, 2021, Switzerland-based company Scewo raised a total of CHF 11.5 million in Series A funding round to advance its growth and expansion. With this capital, the startup intends to accelerate company growth as well as international expansion. Verve Ventures, Rajat Khare-led European investment firm Boundary Holding and three more private investors took part in the funding round.

BRO is the only power wheelchair in the world that combines driving on two wheels with climbing stairs. Impressed by the versatility of the product, Mr. Khare, founder of European deep tech investment firm Boundary Holding met with the founders, Bernhard and Pascal in Switzerland. He saw that the founders had the kind of vision and passion that he strongly relates to and closed the deal soon after.

However, it is not just the unique technology, but also the distinctive design that sets BRO apart. The device offers individual seating comfort to the users. Thanks to the regular software updates, it also keeps getting more intelligent, offering more possibilities, creating a world that people with reduced mobility can discover independently and flexibly.

Talking about the development, Bernhard Winter, co-founder of Scewo said, “The interest from customers is huge! We are now evaluating strategically located and qualified distribution partners to offer local test drives and a good service.”

Established in 2014, Scewo also won the Swiss Medtech Award 2021 for its innovation and robust growth recently. BRO has also won several notable design awards independently after emerging as one of its kind power wheelchair. The device is equipped with sensors that measure environment and recognize the end of a staircase.

The power wheelchair can be controlled with a BRO-App on your smartphone or with the control panel that can be attached on either side. One can also control the direction and speed with the hand joystick, making it flexible and adaptable to various needs. The maximum speed of BRO is 10 km per hour and the battery offers over 1000 charging cycles. Users can also integrate an ever-increasing range of accessories in the device as per need.",1
"Swedish startup Voi raises over €101 million to deliver safe and sustainable micromobility for everyone. Voi Technology, one of Europe’s micromobility giants, has just raised €101.8 million in an oversubscribed funding round to continue its vision for a revolutionised approach to urban transport.

The funding was led by Raine Group and VNV Global including Inbox Capital, Nordic Ninja, Stena Sessan, Kreos Capital and new investors Ilmarinen, Nineyards Equity and ICT Capital and others. Leading entrepreneurs and operators from King, Avito, BCG and more also participated in the fundraising round.

The fresh funding boost comes on the back of an exciting year for the Stockholm-based startup, having raised over €38 million in August. Micromobility is a booming trend in Europe and the industry has been heating up over the past few weeks with new funding announcements and acquisitions.

As one of the e-transport leaders in Europe, Voi, founded in 2018, has enjoyed a 140% year on year revenue growth this year. The young company hit over 90 million rides since launch whilst simultaneously increasing margins and profitability as e-scooters have become the European micromobility choice of 2021. 

After COP26 and a global drive to move to more sustainable choices, cities are under more pressure than ever to transform their transport operations and reduce the reliance on polluting vehicles to meet net-zero emissions targets. E-scooters, e-bikes and other forms of micromobility are the best choice for cities that want a sustainable, shared vehicle that integrates easily with public transport, reduces reliance on private cars, relieves congestion and cuts pollution. 

With an ambition to have fully electric operational vehicles by early 2023 and the plan to exclusively use battery cells produced in Europe (reducing carbon footprint by up to 50%), Voi has a strict commitment to sustainability. The micromobility operator already sources its e-bikes from Europe and intends to source its e-scooters locally, as soon as that is possible. The startup was also one of the first micromobility company’s in Europe to operate carbon-neutrally in 2020, building on its track record of pioneering sustainability initiatives including using renewable power and introducing swappable batteries. 

Fredrik Hjelm, co-founder and CEO of Voi Technology, said: “There is no doubting that micromobility is here to stay and Voi intends to be the go-to mobility platform in Europe for cities that want to give their residents and visitors an integrated, smart mode way to travel. Working closely with cities we are seeing a new vision of urban transport taking shape that is highly complementary to public transport. We are building the future of transport and we are committed to making every Voi city a better place to live.”

Voi already operates in over 70 cities across 11 countries. With headquarters in Stockholm, the sustainability-focused startup employs 1000 people and has more than 6 million users. 

The new funding will support the e-scooter operator to continue expanding into new European markets and add more e-bikes to the Voi fleet. Voi has set an ambition to take 1 billion car trips off Europe’s roads by 2030 and expansion into new markets and solutions is integral to achieving this.  Voi will also launch Europe’s safest e-scooter model to date – the Voiager 5 – this spring as part of its commitment to achieving Vision Zero (no accidents).",1
"Autonomous Einride T-pod Enters Service On A Public Road
It's another small step in the development of fully autonomous electric trucks. The Swedish startup Einride and global logistics provider DB Schenker launched earlier this month the first commercial installation of a T-pod all-electric autonomous truck on a public road in Sweden.

We first heard about the T-pod in 2017 and it seems that after two years of development, the Einride T-pod is ready for a pilot project and real-world tests of autonomous driving Level 4 at low speed of 5 km/h (3.1 mph).

The Einride T-pod entered service at DB Schenker facility in Jönköping, Sweden in November 2018 and in March the Swedish Transport Agency approved it to operate on a public road - ""a short distance on a public road within an industrial area – between a warehouse and a terminal – where traffic speeds are typically low"". The truck is autonomous (there is no cabin), but with remote control by a supervisor.

We assume that successful operation will enable it to gradually improve the system and expand in terms of area and speed.",1
"Air transportation startup Avelo Airlines lands $42M in Series B funding to offer affordable travel and low fares starting at $29. Southwest Airlines is known for its affordable and low-priced fares and unmatched profitability in the industry. According to the information on its website, the company has been profitable for 38 years in a row. Now, one startup wants to give Southwest a run for its money with unbeatable and affordable air travel starting as low as $19 per fare.

Enter Avelo Airlines, a Houston, Texas-based air transportation startup founded in 2020 by Andrew Levy, a former Allegiant Air co-founder and president, and former CFO of United Airlines. Avelo started flying on April 28, 2021, and became the first new mainline airline in the U.S. in 15 years. The startup provides affordable and low-cost travel and a refreshingly smooth and caring experience through its Avelo Soul of Service culture.

Even with the recent slowdown in travel due to the ongoing pandemic, this might not seem like the most opportune time to launch a new airline. However, as we all know, most of today’s successful companies were created during bad times. Avelo is not an exception, especially backed by veterans with decades of airline experience.

To further grow its operations and expand its geographic coverage areas, Avelo announced today it has raised $42 million in Series B funding. This second-round offering increases Avelo’s invested capital base to over $160 million. In addition, an investment fund managed by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value (MSTV) invested an extra $30 million beyond their Series A investment. With this additional significant investment, MSTV is now by far Avelo’s largest shareholder.

The announcement comes a year after the company raised approximately $125 million in January 2020. Avelo said the Series B shares sold at a significant premium to the original Series A shares.

“The incremental capital we’ve raised is a significant vote of confidence in Avelo’s initial momentum and the enormous opportunity ahead of us,” said Avelo Founder, Chairman and CEO Andrew Levy. “This additional capital significantly bolsters our already strong balance sheet and enables the acceleration of Avelo’s growth trajectory in 2022 and beyond.”

“The Morgan Stanley Tactical Value Investing Team is pleased to partner up once again with Avelo Airlines on their recent capital raise,” said Tom Cahill, Managing Director and Co-Head of Morgan Stanley Tactical Value, and an Avelo board member. “Andrew and the rest of the Avelo team have done a terrific job in growing the business under unique circumstances. Avelo’s recent launch of service from its Tweed-New Haven base is just the latest company success, and with the additional capital in place positions Avelo for an even more exciting future.”

This second-round offering was primarily funded by Series A shareholders including Levy, board members (or the entities they represent), and members of management who collectively invested more than $34.7 million.

Levy added, “The personal investments made by Avelo’s management team and board members exemplify the internal belief in Avelo’s potential. I also want to thank Tom Cahill and Morgan Stanley Tactical Value for their significant investment in Avelo. Avelo would not be possible without their confidence and backing.”

Executing Today and Investing in Tomorrow
Avelo initiated service on April 28, 2021, from its first base at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR). The airline – which offers a convenient, affordable, and caring experience – currently serves 19 popular destinations across the U.S. with Boeing Next-Generation (NG) 737 aircraft. Avelo launched its East Coast base at Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN) on November 3, 2021, connecting Southern Connecticut and six popular Florida destinations.

“I am extremely proud of Avelo’s public debut and initial performance amidst the unprecedented challenges that confronted the U.S. airline industry in 2021,” continued Levy. “Our Customers want reliability, convenience and affordability – Avelo is delivering all three. As we head into 2022, I am very bullish about the next exciting stage in Avelo’s journey.”

In just one year, Avelo achieved major milestones including creating over 330 jobs held by Avelo Crewmembers. The startup ended in 2021with six NG 737s (three 737-700s and three 737-800s) and flew 345,000 customers on 3,000 flights. Also in 2021, Avelo delivered a completion factor of 99.8% – canceling only seven flights since its inaugural departure.

Avelo currently operates a fleet of Boeing Next-Generation 737 aircraft, Avelo serves 19 popular destinations across the U.S., including its West Coast base at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR) and its East Coast base at Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN).",1
"EV tech startup Faraday Future raises new funding for the production launch of its FF91 electric SUV.  In July, Faraday Future delayed the launch of its flagship electric SUV FF91 after warning that it was short on cash. The Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup, which went public in a July 2021 merger with a blank-check company, was hoping to raise $325 million to fund its operation through the end of the year. It appears the startup was able to raise funding from investors after many months of struggle.

Today, Faraday Future announced it has successful execution of a definitive agreement for a new financing facility. As part of the new financing agreement, which has total potential funding of as much as $600 million in a convertible secured notes structure, Faraday Future will receive an initial $52 million of committed funds.

The funds are managed and led by ATW Partners.”Investors contributing $27 million (plus up to $31 million from additional investors who commit on or prior to August 17, 2022, and fund on or prior to August 19, 2022) will receive a conversion price of $2.2865 per FFIE share, later contributions will receive a conversion price of $2.69 per FFIE share,” the company said in a press release on Monday.

To further ramp up its production through the end of the year and beyond, Faraday Future says it remains in active discussions with both U.S. institutional investors and international funding sources.

“I am very pleased to have this important new committed capital and framework in place for substantial additional funding. We are working diligently to complete this capital raise process in order to raise sufficient new funds to launch the FF 91. Subject to successful completion of this fundraising process, I am confident that we can deliver cars to our customers in late Q3 or Q4.” said Dr. Carsten Breitfeld, Global CEO of Faraday Future.

Dr. Breitfeld added, “Our Hanford manufacturing facility, recently renamed the “FF ieFactory California” is nearing completion. We have all the equipment on site needed to begin production and are in the final stages of installation. The FF ieFactory California has already produced over a dozen production-intent vehicles. Testing and validation of the FF 91 is well underway, and I am very pleased with the results we are seeing. The FF 91 will be the world’s first ultra-luxury EV and will reset customer expectations for what the future of intelligent mobility can be.”

We covered Faraday Future over a year ago after it announced its plans to go public via SPAC. A few months later, Faraday Future went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp in July 2021.

In March 2021. the EV startup came under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation for making inaccurate statements to its investors. The SEC subpoenaed some members of its management team as part of a probe into inaccurate statements made to its investors, according to a report from Reuters.

Meanwhile, Faraday Future’s former CEO Jia Yueting filed for chapter 11 personal bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2019 and now serves as chief product and ecosystem officer at the company. The startup also said that it would miss the deadline for filing its 2021 annual report due to delays caused by the internal investigation.



Founded in 2014, Faraday Future is a pre-production EV startup company developing global solutions that re-imagine transportation, content, and ownership. The startup once promised to start making and selling its so-called flagship FF91 SUV as early as 2018, but it has been forced to postpone the delivery of its first mass-market production several times.",1
"Dutch testing tube unveiled by Hyperloop transport system. A Dutch tech startup and a construction company on Thursday unveiled a Hyperloop test facility, a steel tube that will be used to help develop the futuristic high-speed transportation system.

It is a first step toward developing the system in the Netherlands, a key European transportation transport hub, and beyond.

“It’s our goal to let it be available for the daily commuter,” said Tim Houter, CEO of Hardt Global Mobility, which is working on the project with construction company BAM. He described the concept as “a sort of on-demand, high-speed transportation system for everyone.”

The Hyperloop was first proposed in 2013 by SpaceX and Tesla Motors co-founder Elon Musk to transport “pods” of people through a tube at speeds of roughly 700 mph (1,126 kph). A Hyperloop has levitating pods powered by electricity and magnetism that hurtle through low-friction pipes. The new test facility, a 30-meter (100-foot) long, 3.2-meter (10.5-feet) diameter tube, is located at Delft Technical University.

Houter, who was part of a team of students from the university that won a Hyperloop contest organized by Musk in January, said the tube will be used for low-speed testing in a vacuum.

“So there will be a vehicle inside this tube going back and forth with the levitation system we’re using, the stabilization system we’re using and the safety systems,” he said.

Ultimately the startup wants to build a longer high-speed facility for testing cornering and lane switching. Hardt then aims to begin construction of a Hyperloop route between two cities within the next four years.

Dutch Infrastructure and Environment Minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen said a Hyperloop system could help cement the Netherlands’ position as a gateway to Europe by transporting freight arriving at Rotterdam’s sprawling port.

“If you then can move the goods in a fast way to the rest of Europe, this is very important for competition,” she said.",1
"Bus Tracking App Chalo Raises $7 Mn To Expand Network To New Cities. Transport tech startup Chalo has raised $7 Mn funding from existing investors Raine Ventures, WhatsApp’s former chief business officer Neeraj Arora, and former senior vice president and head of Google Search Amit Singhal. The family offices of Dabur’s Saket Burman and Tarun Sawhney of Triveni Group also participated in the round, along with other investors.

With this latest round of funding, Chalo has raised a total of $30 million till date. According to media reports, in 2019, Xiaomi’s Shunwei Capital was looking to acquire 10% stake in the company for INR 50 Cr ($6.8 Mn, at current conversion rate) at a valuation of INR 500 Cr ($68 Mn, at current conversion rate). This was expected to be part of the company’s Series B round.

The company, which was founded in 2014 by Vinayak Bhavnani and carwale.com’s cofounder Mohit Dubey, had raised its Series A round in 2017 from WaterBridge Ventures and seed round in 2015-16. The startup helps users navigate through the daily schedules of buses in 30 cities. The company also offers solutions for consumers and bus operators.

It offers live bus tracking showing live arrival times of the buses and a live passenger indicator that shows how crowded the bus is in real-time. The passengers can also use the Chalo app to buy mobile tickets and bus passes and pay digitally for their bus ticket using QR codes.",1
"Electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors names new CEO following Foxconn deal. Electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors said Tuesday that its president, Edward Hightower, will be its new CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds Daniel Ninivaggi, who moves into a strategic role as the company’s executive chairman.

Hightower, a veteran engineer with past experience at Ford Motor and General Motors, will continue to lead the company’s joint venture with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, which bought Lordstown’s Ohio factory for $230 million in May. The joint venture plans to design and develop EVs, which will be manufactured by Foxconn. “With over 30 years of automotive experience and having made significant contributions to the Endurance launch preparation and Foxconn transactions, Edward is the perfect person to lead the company and launch our product development efforts with Foxconn,” Ninivaggi said in a statement. 

Ninivaggi joined Lordstown in August 2021 after the company’s founder, Steve Burns, was forced out amid allegations that he had misled investors. Ninivaggi is credited with leading an overhaul of Lordstown’s production plan for the Endurance, an electric pickup truck, and with engineering the sale of its factory to Foxconn in exchange for much-needed capital. He will focus on “corporate strategy, strategic partnerships, and capital raising” in his new role, the company said.

Lordstown’s shares were up more than 3% in premarket trading after the announcement.",1

"Privado is “Grammarly for code privacy issues”. Privacy breaches are not only bad for users, but also costly for tech companies. For example, GDPR fines now total $1.7 billion, and earlier this year Twitter had to pay $150 million for misrepresenting the security and privacy of user data. Based in Pune, India and Delaware, Privado wants to make it easier for developers to keep user data under wraps.

The company announced today that it has raised $14 million in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capita India and Insight Partners. Together Fund and Emergent Fund, which led Privado’s seed round of $3.5 million in January 2022, also returned for the new funding.

Privado’s Series A will enable it to grow its tech, increase its team to 25 people and grow its open source community. It is post-revenue and has signed six-figure contracts. Its pricing model is based on the number of code repositories, or products, that it scans and monitors.

Privado currently monitors over 600,000 code commits and its clients include Here.com, Thrasio and Zego. It was founded last year by Jasdeep Cheema, Prashant Mahajan and Vaibhav Antil, who previously worked in product and engineering teams. They were motivated to launch Privado after interviewing product and engineering teams at an e-commerce company that needed to find a way to monitor data usage and how it changed with each new software release.

The founders told TechCrunch in an email that “to comply with with any of the privacy laws, the first step is to get visibility into how personal data is being collected, used and shared across thousands of apps and services (Netflix famously has over 1,000 services) powering a tech company. Even if companies achieve this mammoth of a task, realistically, it is close to impossible to continue having visibility when code changes take place every week.”

They added that many of the current tools on the market are manual ones that don’t scale and go out-of-date as soon as there is a product change, or automated ones that only focus on discovering where data is stored, opening the possibility of missing issues around data collection, usage, sharing and personal data leakages.

“There are a lot of privacy tech companies that exist today and some of them have raised big rounds like OneTrust, BigID,” said Antil, Privado’s CEO. “Current tools fall short because they sit outside of the development lifecycle where decisions on data collection, use and sharing are made.”

Privado solves these issues connects with source code management tools including GitHub and scanning code for privacy. It’s able to monitor data usage, identify data flows and notify developers of privacy issues, including excessive user privileges or data leakages to logs.

“Think of us as Grammarly for your code,” the founders say. “We give you a data privacy score for existing products and point out privacy and data security issues as you are writing new code.”

It also created a free tool for Android developers that generates Play Store data safety reports that is used by developers including Automattic and Blinkist. Privado is now expanding it into an open source privacy code canning project.

“We tell engineers to build code and ship features out fast, and we tell them they are responsible for privacy,” said Antil. “If we are giving them the tools to grow engagement, we should also give them tools to grow privacy at the same time.”",0
"SoftBank-backed Tridge, a Korean platform that matches food agriculture buyers and sellers, bags $37.2M Series D at a $2.7B valuation. Supply chain disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine is driving increased costs of goods and services, affecting not only the industrial sector (e.g., semiconductors), but also the agriculture industry. Global food prices have dropped for three consecutive months but still remain relatively high compared to last year, per the 2022 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

South Korean startup Tridge wants to address the issue via its online trade platform that matches global food agriculture buyers and sellers. The platform helps from research to ordering and enables buyers to source their food and agriculture items at reasonable prices in more than 150 countries. Vendors can also diversify their sales channels and find buyers (at the proper time) for perishable foods.

Tridge said Thursday it has secured $37.2 million (50 billion won) in a Series D funding round at a postmoney valuation of $2.7 billion. The latest funding, led by South Korean private equity firm DSAsset, brings Tridge’s total financing to $111.7 million since its inception in 2015.


The new valuation represents about 440%, or 5.4x, increase over Tridge’s postmoney valuation of $500 million in July 2021 when it raised $60 million in its Series C from Korean venture capital firm Forest Partners.

Tridge says its valuation has soared in about a year because it has generated revenues in Tridge’s fulfillment service business since September 2021 after raising the Series C round. Tridge, which posted less than $7.4 million (10 billion won) in sales last year, now generates between $15 million and $23 million in sales per month, according to the company.

Its fulfillment solution serves as a middleman for more than 15,000 agricultural products, enabling buyers to source and get delivered on time. Additionally, more than 100,000 suppliers across 150 countries can sell their food and agriculture products on Tridge’s platform. The company’s market intelligence service, launched in 2020, offers food supply chain analysis and market reports of agricultural products and commodities like apples, strawberries, tomatoes, avocados, black peppercorn, coconut, garlic, seafood and coffee beans. Tridge owns data covering approximately 15,000 agricultural products with 50,000 price updates. (The company claims it has amassed more than 1 trillion data points cumulatively.) That means users can check current and previous wholesale prices, volume, and market share of every agricultural product Tridge covered.

“Now there are a lot of actual transactions [on Tridge’s platform] occurring in many countries, including the U.S., Brazil, Turkey, India, Vietnam, Australia, Tanzania, the Netherlands, and Canada,” Hoshik Shin, founder and CEO of Tridge, told TechCrunch. “The sales have been on the rise since September last year.”

Shin noticed information asymmetry between food agriculture buyers and sellers in the commodity market back in 2012 when he struggled to supply 60,000 tons of coal for Korean and Japanese steel companies in his capacity as a commodity investor at an investment bank. After paying a higher price for the coal due to the lack of transparency and information, Shin founded Tridge to address this issue.


“Tridge is trying to solve problems such as global supply chain collapse and agflation,” Shin said. “With this investment, we will accelerate overseas expansion plans.”

Tridge claims it has 447,786 users today, up from 343,401 users in June 2021. The startup’s customers range from farmers to global retailers, including Costco, Kellogg’s, Walmart, Nestle, Dole, Sysco, Lotte Mart, Mitsui & Co., Carrefour and Indofood.

The number of its customers naturally increased as demand for platforms like Tridge in the agriculture industry surged during the coronavirus pandemic that restricted travel and face-to-face meetings, according to the company.

Tridge plans to use the newly secured capital to launch new services, invest in its technology, and further expand its overseas business, focusing on the U.S., Europe and other countries such as Turkey, Brazil, India, Vietnam and Tanzania, Shin said. Its previous backers include SoftBank Ventures Asia and Activant Capital.

"Canada’s seed market set a record in Q2. Why is the US starting to retract? The earliest stages of venture investing are the most insulated from macroeconomic conditions. When the public market dislocation started causing a broad venture funding pullback, it appeared seed investing would be safe for a while. Data indicates that that is bearing out as expected. But checking in halfway through the year, some markets are faring better than others.

Canada, for one, is having a great year. The second quarter saw the most capital invested into Canadian seed-stage companies yet. New data from the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association found that CAD$263 million (USD$202 million) was invested in Q2 through 104 seed deals, the second highest deal count on record.

Canada’s seed investment volume increased by 30% in Q2 over Q1 and was up 8% over its second-best quarter on record, Q2 2021, when CAD$243 million was invested. Meanwhile, U.S. seed funding declined 35% from Q1 to Q2 of this year, according to data from PitchBook.",0
"Mad Realities’ Devin Lewtan is onboarding crypto users through reality television. Web3 doesn’t have the most inclusive reputation, yet so many crypto founders talk about onboarding the next 100 million users into the space. Statistically speaking, the next 100 million can’t possibly be comprised entirely of a homogenous group of white men who spend most of their waking hours coding and/or day trading (no shade, just pointing out a fact)!

This week on Chain Reaction, I interviewed Devin Lewtan, a twentysomething founder who seems to have found the secret sauce when it comes to bringing web3 to new audiences.

Her NYC-based media company, Mad Realities, just debuted its first season of “Proof of Love,” a reality TV show focused on dating that allows viewers to engage with the plot and vote on key decisions through NFTs. This April, Mad Realities raised $6 million in a seed round from investors including crypto VC firm Paradigm and socialite Paris Hilton to build a platform they hope will become the “Netflix of web3.” You can listen to the full interview with Devin below. “We think the thing that’s going to bring the next 100 million people into crypto is going to be content, because it’s intuitive. It’s a real consumer use case,” Lewtan said on the podcast.

Lewtan, who catapulted into tech world fame when she co-released the viral Clubhouse show “NYU Girls Roasting Tech Guys” during the height of the pandemic, first got interested in NFTs when she started chatting with her friend and co-founder Alice Ma about how crypto could help change the way media is funded.

“We put out a blog post basically saying, what would it look like if we put on this dating show where people minted our NFTs and they could vote on who made it into the show, what happens and who wins and get fun, special, governance perks based on the tier that they bought,” Lewtan said.

Shortly after the Mad Realities team released its first blog post in November, they had raised the equivalent of ~$500,000 USD worth of ethereum to finance production. In a matter of just a few months, they had whipped up a five-week, interactive show filmed in person in New York City.


The audience for the first season, which wrapped up in April this year, was ~55% female and comprised mainly of people who were just there for the entertainment value of the show at first rather than for its connection to web3, Lewtan said. Once audience members saw the perks and voting rights afforded to Mad Realities NFT holders, called “roseholders” in a nod to “The Bachelor” franchise, they were intrigued.

“They were able to say to their friends, I’m pretty sure that these roseholders that keep appearing are people who bought NFTs, and those NFTs let them vote on things, and then the money from the NFTs funded the show. And then they’re like, that actually makes sense to me, more than most projects in the space … that’s not really like the scammy type of use case that I think about with NFTs,” Lewtan said.

As for what’s next, Lewtan said the next season of “Proof of Love” expected to launch early next year will inform the startup as it crafts a broader vision for what a web3 media platform could look like. They are experimenting with ideas such as bringing other content creators onto the Mad Realities platform and helping them launch their own NFT projects for their audiences, she added.",0
"Meta invests in Take App, a Singaporean startup that helps merchants sell via WhatsApp. WhatsApp has long transcended its roots as a simple messaging app for friends, and is now a core communication tool for businesses seeking a direct channel to their customers’ pockets — both literally and metaphorically. Countless companies have turned to the omnipresent messaging app as they build the very foundation of their business, something that hasn’t gone unnoticed by WhatsApp’s parent company.

Indeed, Meta Platforms Inc. — the corporate megabrand behind Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp — recently invested in Take App, a fledgling Singaporean startup founded by former Facebook engineering manager Youmin Kim, who left the social network last year to work on a new product that promises to bridge the digital gap for small-business owners in Southeast Asia. The investment came through Meta’s NPE team, which announced it would begin making seed-stage investments last year.

At its core, Take App serves as an easy way for those with little technical know-how to set up a simple website to facilitate online orders, replete with a shopping cart, payments and a direct connection to WhatsApp for managing and tracking the final order. While restaurants are a central focus for the Take App service, the company also works with bakeries, grocery businesses and beauty salons, among others.

“Our unique selling point is that we let merchants keep direct WhatsApp conversations with customers,” Kim explained to TechCrunch. “Merchants love the idea that they receive notifications and order details directly in WhatsApp — no other app or login is required.”

On top of that, Take App is looking to help businesses drive repeat customers through maintaining a database, with support for creating and sending newsletters (like a “Mailchimp for WhatsApp”) that include special offers or relevant company updates. While the core Take App service is free, the company offers a bunch of premium features, including things like advanced analytics, unlimited image uploads and custom domain names.",0
"Lumachain, using computer vision to transform meat production, bites into new capital. It’s widely known now that our current food production is not adequate enough to keep up with the growing population expected to come in the next three decades, which is why alternative meat products are being developed.

But at a time when some food industry startups are trying to remove animals from the food chain, a company tackling the traditional meat industry is a rarity.

Lumachain aims to become the industry standard for how beef, chicken and pork products are produced globally. “The global industry is worth $1.5 trillion per annum, and it helps feed the world,” company founder and CEO Jamila Gordon told TechCrunch. “Each plant is a huge business in its own right. It can have from 500 employees to thousands of employees per shift. What we have failed to do is build a computer vision tech and AI that helps transform the industry.”

That’s Lumchain’s goal: help the global meat industry innovate and solve some of the key challenges they face, including employee shortages, the impact of inflation and high operational costs, supply chain disruptions and that meat plants are still operating the same way they did 50 years ago.

Supply chain disruptions were exacerbated during the pandemic, and with meat being a perishable product, it has a short shelf life, and if it is stuck somewhere and there is no visibility, that could mean hundreds of thousands of pounds of meat thrown away, Gordon explained.

A Somali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War, Gordon’s first job out of college was cooking in a Japanese restaurant where the chef took her under his wing to learn the trade. Even though she had a degree in computer science and later worked at companies like IBM and as chief information officer for Qantas Airways, her passion continued to be with the food industry.


The innovation Gordon has seen in the food industry is more “incremental rather than transformational.” That’s why she believes AI should be helping employees be the best they can be. She even did a TED Talk about it.

Lumachain was founded in 2018 to use computer vision-based artificial intelligence to transform meat plant operations. It has five products in the categories of safety, yield, quality, efficiency and traceability.

The company installs cameras around the plant to identify potential safety hazards and training and coaching opportunities for plant supervisors who often have 50 employees under them. The AI will send real-time alerts to the supervisor so they can focus on those who need extra help instead of having to monitor each employee separately.

In addition, during COVID, customers knew where their containers were at any given time, and if there was a potential for spoilage, could redirect the products to other endpoints so there would not be losses.


“As we were talking about not enough workers, you want your employees to be the best that they can be and offer real-time coaching and training,” Gordon said. “Traceability is creating that transparency that helps our customers track the food from farm to fork and know where their product is at any given time.”

Since its founding four years ago, Lumachain’s approach has caught on with meat production companies. It is working in eight countries today and its technology is capturing just under 50% of the meat supply in the U.S., Gordon said.

Today, the company, based in Sydney and now also Denver, announced $19.5 million in Series A funding to continue to accelerate its AI platform globally and scale up its team in the United States. Over the next year, the company expects to increase its team here to approximately 30 people. Its global team is over 100 now.

The funding was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. Lumachain raised a $2.5 million seed round in July 2019 to give it $22 million in total funding to date.


“We aren’t going after other new customers, but instead expanding with our existing customers,” Gordon said. “The next steps are expansion and becoming the global industry standard.”",0
"Zilliz, the startup behind the Milvus open source vector database for AI apps, raises $60M, relocates to SF. In 2020, Chinese startup Zilliz — which builds cloud-native software to process data for AI applications and unstructured data analytics, and is the creator of Milvus, the popular open source vector database for similarity searches — raised $43 million to scale its business and prep the company to make a move into the U.S. Nearly two years on, today Zilliz is announcing further funding of $60 million as it finally makes its move West, with a new HQ in San Francisco to capitalize on the growing demand for more efficient processing techniques for an ever-expanding trove of unstructured data getting commandeered to power AI applications.

Led by Prosperity7 Ventures — a $1 billion venture fund created by Saudi oil giant Aramco (the name is a reference to the first commercial well to strike oil in the country) — the round also includes previous Chinese backers Temasek’s Pavilion Capital, Hillhouse Capital, 5Y Capital and Yunqi Capital. The company is not disclosing its valuation, but it’s worth pointing out that this latest injection is being described as an extension to that $43 million Series B rather than a new round. We’ll update this if we learn more. The total raised by the company is now $113 million.

The capital and relocation speaks not just to a key moment for the company, but also for the area of machine learning and wider trends impacting Chinese-founded startups.


On the first of these, Zilliz’s breakout product, the open source Milvus, has boomed. The company said that downloads have now passed the 1 million mark, compared to 300,000 a year ago, with production users growing by 300% in the same period — however, it didn’t disclose its active user numbers. Customers include the likes of eBay, Tencent, Walmart, Ikea, Intuit and Compass.

As we pointed out back in 2020, Milvus has not leaned heavily on advertising and marketing spend, instead choosing to leverage word of mouth on the places where developers like to hang out for ideas and inspiration to get itself noticed, such as GitHub and Reddit. That strategy has worked: “Stargazers” on GitHub are up 200% to more than 11,000 with the number of contributors doubling. (For a point of comparison, in 2020 it had been starred some 4,400 times.)

The reason for the interest in Milvus — and subsequently Zilliz’s roadmap, which is based around creating further products, most recently a Zilliz Cloud-managed service that is now in private preview; and Towhee, another open source framework, this one for for vector data ETL — is because of the rising interest in vector databases as how they are being used in AI applications.

Put simply, while data can be (and often is) processed via more traditional databases, the complexity of and structure of activities like anomaly detection, recommendation, rating and other AI-driven tasks lends itself more naturally and efficiently to vector databases designed to work with how AI data is represented. (Zilliz notes that its vector database “is both cloud native and capable of processing billion-scale vector data in milliseconds.”)

“Zilliz’s journey to this point started with the creation of Milvus, an open-source vector database that eventually joined the LF AI & Data Foundation as a top-level project,” said Charles Xie, founder and CEO of Zilliz, in a statement. “Milvus has now become the world’s most popular open-source vector database with over a thousand end-users. We will continue to serve as a primary contributor and committer to Milvus and deliver on our promise to provide a fully managed vector database service on public cloud with the security, reliability, ease of use, and affordability that enterprises require.”


There are others (competitors to Zilliz) like Pinecone and Weaviate also building solutions to address this. Pinecone raised money earlier this year and has some impressive names backing it, including Tiger Global and Menlo Ventures (for a point of comparison, PitchBook says Pinecone’s valuation is $168 million). Weaviate’s parent, SeMI Technologies out of The Netherlands, also raised this year, backed by the likes of NEA.

Meanwhile, big cloud providers like AWS also have their own solutions. All of that points to a market opportunity that Zilliz is focused to tackle.

It’s notable that back in 2020, Zilliz already said that more than half of the users of Milvus were outside of China: That speaks to how the company has long positioned itself and where it saw its growth longer-term. Xie — who goes by the nickname “Starlord” (yes) and previously worked as a software engineer at Oracle in the U.S. before relocating to start Zilliz in Shanghai — told TC that he thought of the startup as “global from day one.” But he saw an opportunity to build first in Shanghai because of the affordability of hiring engineers as well as the market size of China, and thus the volume of unstructured data to hand.

“The amount of unstructured data in a region is in proportion to the size of its population and the level of its economic activity, so it’s easy to see why China is the biggest data source,” he said at the time.
Of course, these days, as a number of startups in the country are looking to move elsewhere to have more freedom in terms of how they grow their businesses, and to work with a wider set of customers, Zilliz is an example of that in action.

Prosperity7 has been playing a role in facilitating this migration. The fund only entered China last year and has been actively hunting down startups with a global ambition, which could tap the firm’s vast global network. We recently covered two such investments, Jaka, a Beijing- and Shanghai-based collaborative robotics startup, and Insilico, an AI drug platform from Hong Kong.

Prosperity7’s investment in Zilliz seems to fit nicely into the investor’s mandate. It’s not uncommon to see Chinese SaaS companies going global these days. Many are started by Chinese entrepreneurs with an international background. They might have spent a few years testing the market at home and raising from VCs who are increasingly keen on B2B projects as the B2C space becomes saturated. But many find it hard to monetize in China, where small and medium enterprise owners are still reluctant to pay for software subscriptions compared to their Western corporate counterparts.

“With its leadership on Milvus, Zilliz is a global leader in vector similarity search on massive amounts of unstructured data,” said Aysar Tayeb, executive MD of Prosperity7 Ventures, in a statement. “We believe that the company is in a strong position to build a cloud platform around Milvus that will unleash new and powerful business insights and outcomes for its customers, just as data analytics platforms like Databricks and Snowflake have done with structured data. There is already over 4x more unstructured data than structured data, a gap that will continue to grow as AI, robotics, IoT, and other technologies meld the digital and physical realms.”",0
"WakeUp Labs teams up with Kilimo to generate water-saving certificates using NFTs and save up to 40% in water for irrigation. If you think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are just about funny monkey JPEG images, think again. Although the technology is still in its infant stage, NFTs can be used to represent ownership of any digital assets. Because each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced by another token, NFT can be used in different industries including arts, decentralized marketplaces, and supply chain management.

NFT can also be used in agriculture, water management, and environmental causes. An example of this is how two startups are working together to use NFT to help save up to 40% in water for irrigation.

Kilimo is a big data startup that provides solutions for water management in agriculture. The startup features climate monitoring by using satellite and site data to provide prescriptions for each crop and increase water use efficiency.

Kilimo and WakeUp Labs recently joined forces to tokenize water savings through NFTs to achieve water-neutral goals and reward farmers.

Today, WakeUp Labs, which is built on Rootstock, announced it has partnered with Kilimo, one of the leading digital platforms for irrigation management in agriculture, to provide the technology infrastructure for generating water-saving certificates using non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

This means that farmers’ water savings will be represented by an NFT, which can be bought by companies that want to compensate for their water footprint. This mechanism will generate additional income for farmers who use irrigation efficiently.

WakeUp Labs, part of Rootstock Ecosystem, will support the creation of NFTs certificates that will be registered on the blockchain, thus providing clear evidence of the water savings achieved. Rootstock, the first Bitcoin sidechain that brings smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin network, has more than 50% of the Bitcoin hash rate, which makes this entire ecosystem one of the most secure in the world.

Kilimo is a ClimTech start-up that verifies and helps to improve water consumption in agriculture. They use Big Data and Machine Learning to effectively use these resources in agriculture. Their irrigation practices are used by over 2,000 farmers. By 2050, 51 percent of the population could be at high water risk according to a report made by the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) in 2020. And here Kilimo saved over 72 billion liters of water in Latin America.

Kilimo Founder, Jairo Trad, said: “We are excited because Kilimo’s technology will allow farmers to receive income for saving water, and simultaneously companies can offset their water footprint. This is how we can make Everyday DeFi a reality”

“Amazing to see RSK being tapped by these two influential players for a great sustainable cause that’s helping enable innovative everyday DeFi for farmers,” commented Augustin Pandolfini. ",0
"Fusion energy startup Focused Energy scores $15M to generate unlimited carbon-free energy and decarbonize the planet. The global energy demand is projected to grow 47% by 2050. Currently, fossil fuels still remain the largest energy source but oil reserves continue to dwindle. What about clean energy? Researchers also predicted that over the next 30 years cannot be met with existing clean technologies (such as solar or wind).

Even with the help of new energy storage methods, like hydrogen, the future energy gap cannot be closed reliably. It’s for this reason that nuclear scientists are researchers are in a race to a new type of energy source with zero carbon emissions called nuclear fusion.

Unlike the existing nuclear reactor which uses nuclear fission, nuclear fusion harnesses the power of an artificial star on planet Earth to generate electricity and has great advantages over our current sources of energy since nuclear fusion produces no carbon, sulfur, or nitrogen emissions.

Nuclear fusion is a nuclear process where energy is produced by smashing together light atoms. Theoretically, nuclear fusion could provide a cheap, clean, and almost boundless source of energy. For example, one tablespoon of liquid hydrogen fuel—a mix of deuterium and tritium—would produce the same energy as 28 tons of coal.

That’s why companies like Microsoft and Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, and Microsoft are betting on a $10 trillion energy solution for the planet with investments in fusion energy startups like General Fusion and Commonwealth Fusion (CFS). But there’s one other startup working on a more disruptive energy production technology using laser-driven fusion energy.

Enter Focused Energy, a fusion energy startup founded by two physics professors Todd Ditmire and Markus Roth. with expertise in extremely high-powered lasers. Launched last summer, Focused Energy combines direct-drive laser fuel compression with proton fast ignition to generate a commercially attractive path to harvest energy.



The Focused Energy team consists of veterans with many years of experience in the nuclear sector, including Prav Patel, who spent 23 years at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In just a few months, the startup has gotten the attention of investors.

The startup recently scored $15 million in early-stage funding from the venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab, plus Marc Lore (who sold e-commerce companies Diapers.com and Jet.com to Amazon and Walmart respectively), tech investor Tony Florence, and the former Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez.

“Focused Energy is capitalizing on over 70 years of government research into fusion,” Matthew Moynihan, a nuclear fusion consultant, told CNBC. “They have a credible team and a good plan, but they have hard challenges ahead.”

Before founding Focused Energy, Professor Ditmire worked at Livermore for three years, where he worked on the very first ultra-powerful petawatt laser and met Roth. He later joined joined University of Texas in 2020 where he built the Texas Petawatt Laser.

“The U.S. electrical grid produces about a half a trillion watts of power. So that’s a half a terawatt,” Dimitre explained in a conversation in June. “A petawatt is 1,000 trillion watts. So a petawatt laser has the same power as 2,000 times the power output of the United States electrical grid.”

He explained, “You take all the wattage of the sunlight falling on the state of Texas, it’s about 140 terawatts. So I would always say Petawatt is brighter than the Texas sun.”",0
"China’s B2C e-commerce tech startup Dianxiaomi raises $110 million led by SoftBank, Sequoia. Chinese business-to-customer cross-border eCommerce startup Dianxiaomi has raised $110 million in a Series D funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Sequoia China, with the participation of Tiger Global Management, GGV Capital, and others.

SoftBank Vision Fund 2’s investment in Dianxiaomi is surprising considering that the parent company SoftBank just reported its biggest ever loss, posted a $23.4 billion in quarterly loss as the global market sell-off spread to tech stocks.

The latest funding, which brings the company to a total value of USD 210 million, will be used to further expand its overseas team and accelerate international growth. The startup will also use the new capital infusion to develop and release additional products in more countries, to create a worldwide-connected infrastructure.

With millions in the war chest, Dianxiaomi said it plans to open new offices in the UK, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as it is looking for additional markets to expand.

Founded in 2014 by Jianyin Du, Dianxiaomi provides one-stop services for global e-commerce sellers. Its international e-commerce platform has easily become a preferred market solution provider, with annual transaction volumes that exceed RMB 350 million (approximately USD 51.5 million).

Dian Xiaomi said it aims to make cross-border e-commerce less complicated by enabling merchants to set up their stores in one centralized location that simplifies the processes and reduces the risk of human error.

The platform counts over 1.5 million users around the world and has partnered with more than 50 international e-commerce platforms. Moreover, it benefits from 1,600 logistics providers and has opened 80 warehouses abroad to oversee shipping and delivery.

Dian Xiaomi has also created a diversified product map focusing on ERP software as its main solution. It also provides services of e-commerce ERP for Amazon sellers and local sellers in both Latin America and Southeast Asia. It also offers its ERP software to Chinese vendors on a series of popular platforms, including Wish, Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, and Shopee, and focuses on SME sellers with less than 5,000 orders per day.",0
"Israeli tech startup Shopic bags $35M to bring its AI-enabled smart cart to top U.S. grocery chains. These days, leading grocers and retailers are constantly exploring smart cart technologies to meet the growing demand for frictionless shopping and cashier-less checkout. However, introducing purpose-built smart carts to a store is often operationally complicated and very costly.

Enter Shopic, a Tel Aviv, Israel-based smart grocery shopping startup that provides a frictionless shopping experience for medium and large grocery stores. Shopic overcomes these challenges with an AI-powered clip-on device that can turn any standard shopping cart into a smart cart.

We wrote about Shopic a year ago after the Israeli startup closed a $10 million funding to let consumers make purchases in large retail chains without having to wait in line at checkouts. A lot has changed since then. The startup has expanded its footprint. Through partnerships, its AI-enabled smart cart has now been deployed in top grocery chains around the world.

Today, Shopic announced it has raised a $35 million Series B funding to bring its AI-enabled smart cart to top U.S. grocery chains. The round which brings SHopic’s total funding raised to $56 million, was led by Qualcomm Ventures, with participation from other investors including Vintage Investment Partners and Clal Insurance, together with Shopic’s existing investors IBI Tech Fund, Tal Ventures, and Shufersal.

Founded in 2015 by CEO Raz Golan, Dan Bendler, and Eran Kravitz, Shopic is transforming brick-and-mortar stores with its frictionless, personalized retail solutions. The company has developed an AI-powered device that can be attached to any standard shopping cart, turning it into a smart cart.

Shopic offers an AI-powered clip-on device that transforms shopping carts into smart carts. Utilizing computer vision algorithms, Shopic identifies items placed in the cart in real-time, while displaying to shoppers product promotions and discounts on related products. The Shopic system acts as a self-service checkout interface as well, saving customers the time and hassle of standing in line to pay.



Data collected by the company during live deployments of its system found that Shopic’s solution increased shoppers’ monthly spending by 8%.

Shopic not only delivers a new retail experience for in-store shoppers but also provides real-time inventory management and customer behavioral insights for grocers through its analytics dashboard. These reports also include aisle heatmaps, promotion monitoring, and new product adoption metrics.

“Today’s consumers are used to friction-free online shopping experiences, but retailers struggle to deliver them for in-store shoppers,” said Raz Golan, CEO and co-founder of Shopic. “As the only solution that uses full computer vision rather than barcode scanning, Shopic empowers retailers to not only meet customer expectations but to delight them”.

The Series B investment will be used to expand the company’s penetration of global markets. Shopic’s solutions are already deployed by several grocers in Europe, the Americas, and Israel. They include some of the world’s largest supermarket chains.

As opposed to monolithic smart carts, such as Amazon Dash, Shopic’s clip-on device can be used with any shopping cart, offering a highly cost-effective implementation path for grocers. Additionally, shoppers can remove the device when their transactions are complete and use the cart to take their groceries out to the parking lot, completing a truly frictionless shelf-to-car shopping journey.

Inside the cart, Shopic uses a camera duo that enables its AI-computer vision model to support large catalogs of over 50,000 items, cover edge cases and achieve low latency with limited processing power. The algorithm can even identify products thrown into the cart even when it’s in motion or when people put multiple products in their carts simultaneously.

Merav Weinryb, VP of Qualcomm Israel Ltd. and Managing Director of Qualcomm Ventures Israel and Europe, said: “We support Shopic’s vision of hybrid retail, where the best of online shopping and physical store experiences merge. Shopic’s smart cart, which is a compelling and pragmatic smart retail solution is helping enable this future. We were very impressed with the performance of Shopic’s cart in live supermarkets, demonstrating the potential of AI to transform everyday experiences for everyone.”",0
"DeFi tech startup 1inch teams up with KuCoin Wallet to launch its native swap feature. We covered KuCoin three months ago when the crypto exchange hit the unicorn after raising $150 million in Series B funding to expand its presence in Web3, a decentralized version of the Internet that is based on blockchain technology.

Since then, the crypto startup has built new alliances to grow its exchange. One of those partnerships is with 1inch Network, a distributed network for decentralized protocols on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimistic Ethereum, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Gnosis Chain.

Today, 1inch announced it has partnered with KuCoin Wallet to launch its native swap feature. The algorithm will enable users to swap tokens on multiple blockchains at the best possible rates. The 1inch API continues to expand in the DeFi space, now strengthening the swapping functionality of the KuCoin Wallet, focused on opening the gateway to the Web3 world to its users.

As a brand-new DeFi product of the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, the KuCoin Wallet made a huge move in increasing its functionality by partnering with the 1inch Network which leading-edge Pathfinder algorithm helps to introduce native swapping at a high level. It instantly provides the most attractive rates based on an aggregation of over 250 liquidity sources, which include both AMMs and PMMs. The best path is guaranteed by the automatic swap split between protocols, as long as it makes the exchange favorable. The algorithm can even engage different market depths within the same protocol when splitting.

With this integration, KuCoin Wallet users will now appreciate the new swapping experience including the best possible swap rates, access to numerous liquidity sources running on the nine most popular networks, and a great number of tradable asset pairs. In addition, KuCoin Wallet users will have high-level security provided by multiple trustworthy audit teams and benefit from less slippage and lower gas commissions.

In addition to the impressive array of liquidity sources, attractive swap rates and one of the shortest response time, KuCoin Wallet users will also get access to the 1inch Limit Order Protocol functionality. This type of order is filled at a predetermined price once it is reached. It features gasless limit orders for ETH, RFQ and support of tokens requiring just permits rather than transaction approval.

“Swap is a high-frequency feature of the wallet and 1inch is one of the most popular DEXes in the Web3 industry, so we work together through native integration to provide a smooth and cost-effective trading experience for our users”, says the head of KuCoin Wallet Jeff Haul.

KuCoin Wallet takes one step further in offering the KuCoin ecosystem users innovative products and embracing Web 3.0. Designed for easy DeFi trading, it strives to provide customers with all the benefits of the 1inch API-based advanced trading right away.

“The integration of the 1inch API sets a strong start to the wallet”, says the 1inch Network co-founder Sergej Kunz. “The idea of building a collaborative future in Web3 is beautiful, especially when there’s an opportunity to provide a multi-functional and ready-to-use tool, guaranteeing customers´ full DeFi trading immersion”, he adds.",0
"Seattle mental health startup Alongside raises $5.5M, aims to test app with schools. A new startup is emerging in Seattle with plans to partner with schools to support adolescent mental health.

Alongside is developing an app that interacts with students through a chatbot and guides them to resources like videos of other students experiencing similar issues. Users can access therapy exercises and journaling tools, as well as soothing music or breathing techniques.

The app also connects to outside support and refers students in crisis to their school’s support team. The company has lined up pilot programs with public and private middle and high schools this fall, and is signing up more.

Alongside launched this April and recently completed a $5.5 million seed funding round, CEO Jay Goyal told GeekWire. The round was led by Trilogy Equity Partners, with Trilogy Managing Director Amy McCullough joining Alongside’s board. Other backers include Pack VC, Madrona Venture Labs, and individual investors.

“My co-founders and I are motivated to break down barriers for youth reaching their full potential,” said Goyal, who was previously CEO and founder of Seattle-based curriculum platform Actively Learn, which was acquired in 2018 by Achieve3000 and is now owned by McGraw Hill.

The company’s other co-founders, Anish Mehta and Scott Freschet, are also Actively Learn alums. Psychologist Elsa Friis is the company’s head of mental health.

More than one-third of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2019, a 40% increase since 2009, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

Others that use chatbots for mental health include adult-focused companies Woebot Health and Wysa. A different program to assess student mental health through surveys is being piloted in the Seattle area, though it has raised privacy and other concerns. Alongside says what people “reveal and do” on its app is private.

Alongside joins a growing list of mental health startups based across the Pacific Northwest, as the pandemic has fueled interest in the sector.

We interviewed Goyal to learn more about how Alongside’s app works and its potential to support mental health of adolescents amidst increasing need. Answers were edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: What inspired the company?

Jay Goyal: Over the past year, mental health for adolescents has reached the point of crisis. Adolescents have a massive barrier to accessing help — cost, stigma, language, and limited supply of licensed therapists are all well documented problems. We quickly discovered that a low-cost software solution that brought clinical expertise and partnered with schools would have the highest odds of success. Given our experience providing both, we felt confident we could make an impact.

How do you maintain privacy while also helping students in crisis?

We interviewed 60 to 70 teens before deciding to start the company. We heard that they have nowhere to turn with their struggles, and often feel uncomfortable opening up to those who are trying to help (counselors, parents, therapists). Thus, our objective was to create a space where students feel safe, through confidentiality, and can start to get help.

That said, there are reasons why we would share information adolescents provide with others. When our AI detects a crisis, such as self-harm, we provide resources for a user to access immediately (such as calling the 988 Lifeline) and we also notify the school so they can bring the appropriate resources to help.

We are upfront with adolescents about this scenario when their information may be shared, and they have been understanding that those circumstances would require others to be notified.

Can you explain how the chatbot works? How does the tool compare to a real human?

The chatbot is one part of the app. We also provide journaling and grounding activities. The chatbot is designed to run through evidence-informed exercises that can help with feelings of anxiety, depression, trauma, etc. It uses AI sparingly, to understand what feelings and issues an adolescent is struggling with, so it can match exercises that will be most useful. For the exercises, the chatbot provides a more engaging and supportive method to complete versus an alternative of filling out a worksheet.

The tool is not designed to replace a human. It is subclinical and meant to make self-help for adolescents comfortable and supportive. In fact, for many adolescents who struggle to open up, we expect to be an onramp to school counseling so they can get the proper in-person care they may need, for free.

What is your revenue model?

Schools and districts will purchase the app, paying an annual fee per student. [The company is piloting the app for free this fall.]",0
"Seattle startup aiming to detect, treat Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease raises cash. The news: University of Washington spinout AltPep recently raised $44.4 million, according to a regulatory filing. The company declined to discuss the filing, but founder and CEO Valerie Daggett spoke with GeekWire about AltPep’s progress on its experimental blood test to detect Alzheimer’s disease at the earliest stages.

“We’re going after that first molecular trigger for the pathology,” said Daggett, who is also a UW professor of bioengineering. The 3-year old startup is also developing a diagnostic for Parkinson’s disease and treatments for both conditions.

Making progress: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently gave AltPep’s Alzheimer’s test its “breakthrough device” designation, putting it on the path to prioritized review. The company is developing a kit for the test and talking with potential partners, including large diagnostic companies.

AltPep’s tests for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease are also being used in preclinical studies for the company’s candidate treatments for those conditions. The tests would ideally be approved before future clinical trials and would be used in conjunction with them, said Daggett.

Building the company: AltPep raised $23.1 million in a Series A round in January 2021 led by Matrix Capital Investment with participation from Alexandria Venture Investments. AtlPep, located in Seattle’s Northlake neighborhood, now has 25 employees and is hiring.

AltPep also hired a chief medical officer, Gilbert Block, early on. That’s not something a lot of startups do, said Daggett. “Our preclinical studies are being designed with an eye to the clinic,” she said. “We are really trying to bring that in early to not go off in too many tangents.”

The research at AltPep and in Daggett’s UW lab build off of each other. “We can still do a lot of the basic research at UW and publish, and it can help inform what we’re doing with AltPep,” she said.

The people: Other members of the leadership team include Patrik Edenholm, chief operating officer; Charles Horne, chief financial officer; Kurt Becker, VP, legal and business development; and Nancy Hill, chief product officer.

Board members are Daggett, biotech veteran Todd Patrick, Adaptive Biotechnologies co-founder and CEO Chad Robins, Matrix Capital Management co-founder David Goel; and Joel Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities/Alexandria Venture Investments.

How it works: Toxic forms of a molecule called Amyloid-beta are thought to set Alzheimer’s disease in motion, years before the symptoms of Alzheimer’s manifest. Research from multiple labs suggests that Amyloid-beta forms toxic “oligomers” that build up in the brain and trigger a host of other pathologies. AltPep’s diagnostic detects these oligomers, which are also present in the blood.

The company’s approach to treating Alzheimer’s disease targets the same oligomers, with the aim of hijacking the disease before it sets in. “It’s really important to go after the very earliest events,” said Daggett. More science: Daggett and her colleagues showed that the oligomers adopt a specific three-dimensional structure as they form, called an alpha-sheet. The researchers also generated matching peptides, small proteins that bind the structure — these peptides are the basis of the company’s therapeutics and Alzheimer’s test, called SOBA (soluble oligomer-binding assay)-AD. AltPep is taking a similar approach to developing diagnostics and treatments for Parkinson’s disease, which also is associated with a protein that forms alpha-sheets.

State of the field: Despite decades of research and hundreds of clinical trials, big breakthroughs in Alzheimer’s disease treatment remain elusive. One key reason, said Daggett, is that most experimental approaches target the disease well after it is underway, often aiming for Amyloid-beta after it’s formed nasty clumps throughout the brain. The controversial new drug Aduhelm mainly targets forms of Amyloid-beta more prevalent at later disease stages, said Daggett.

Meanwhile, companies like Seattle’s Athira Pharma are aiming for targets other than Amyloid-beta.

Most experimental diagnostics also are geared to detect later stages of the disease, said Daggett. “So far, there hasn’t been a way to diagnose early enough, and there hasn’t been a way to treat early enough, and we’ve got that target,” said Daggett.",0
"Nortis, a Seattle-based startup developing ‘organ-on-a-chip’ tech, raises cash. Nortis, a Seattle-area startup founded in 2011 that markets “organ-on-a-chip” technology, has raised $6 million, according to an SEC filing.

The company’s microfluidic chips foster the growth of human cells in ways that resemble organs, and have been used to create kidney, liver, blood vessel, heart, intestine, and tumor models for researchers.

Nortis has previously received backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and collaborated on a project to send a kidney chip into space. Its chips are used in research studies. The company spun out of VisionGate and is led by Thomas Neumann, a former exec at VisionGate.

We’ve reached out to the company for more details about the new funding and will update if we hear back.",0
"Startup detects COVID-19 using spit, light, and a computer built to analyze patterns. A Seattle-area startup called Pattern Computer is developing a rapid COVID-19 test based on patterns in light from spit, one of several projects moving ahead from the 7-year-old company that designed its own computer from scratch.

The company’s “Pattern Discovery Engine” was created specifically to discover and analyze patterns and excels at the task, said CEO and co-founder Mark Anderson. Pattern Computer keeps the workings of its system closely guarded, and has not published its AI models in peer-reviewed journals. Outside researchers say it’s hard to know what’s under the hood.

But its approach has attracted seasoned computer science talent and biotech heavyweights to the startup.

The company’s chief technology officer, co-founder Ty Carlson, previously managed the Amazon team that launched products such as the Amazon Echo. Its advisory board includes Leroy Hood, a co-founder of the Institute for Systems Biology, genome pioneer Craig Venter, and serial biotech startup founder George Church, a Harvard professor.

Anderson is founder and CEO of technology newsletter Strategic News Service, read by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Michael Dell and Elon Musk, he said. He’s known as a “tech prognosticator” and each year brings together an eclectic mix of tech leaders and scientists at his “Future in Review” conference (he also co-founded the Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, Wash., where he lives).

At his 2015 conference, Anderson hosted a “chief technology officer challenge,” where participants designed a desktop supercomputer. The resulting system formed the seed for Pattern Computer. Participants included the other company co-founders, entrepreneur Brad Holtz and Michael Riddle, who previously co-founded Autodesk, makers of AutoCAD and other industrial software. Pattern Computer focuses on biomedicine. But it also addresses problems in materials design, veterinary medicine, finance, mathematics, and aerospace with its partners, such as an analysis of ways to reduce flight delays.

Pattern Computer has raised $26 million to date, all from individual investors, including Venter and Ken Goldman, former chief financial officer of Yahoo and Pattern’s consulting CFO. The startup is now seeking to raise $40 million with a valuation of $1.2 billion, said Anderson.

“It’s a company that is taking an intriguing new approach to manipulate and analyze big data,” said Hood. And when the pandemic hit, it “thought deeply about the COVID problem,” said Hood.",0
"Please and thank you: Cannabis startup Polite sells science-backed products to treat yourself. The co-founders of Seattle-based cannabis and hemp product company Polite have multiple explanations for their startup name.

It’s about self care that includes THC- and CBD-containing products that address specific health concerns. It’s about replacing the “naughty” stereotype of marijuana with the “nice” alternative of their micro-dose products. It includes making science-backed claims about the tinctures, oral sprays, topical lotions and vaping devices that they’re selling.

“The spirit of Polite is really about treating yourself well and treating others well,” said Sue Tan, Polite co-founder and chief creative officer.

“We use cannabis for mental, physical, [and] social health and when we feel better as people,” she said, “in turn that has a knock on effect on our partners, children, our families, our communities.”

In January 2020, Polite launched its cannabis products containing THC, the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana. In April 2022 it began selling non-THC hemp goods with CBD. Products from both lines include a variety of cannabinoids — the biologically active components of cannabis and hemp — as well as other medicinal herbs. Polite distinguishes itself by its focus is on health-related products, in contrast to purely recreational use.

With the legalization of marijuana, “patient-focused products were kind of ignored and thrown by the wayside,” said Yung Tan, co-founder and CEO. The health and wellness piece disappeared, he said, so “we put the ‘medical’ back into medical marijuana.”

The company is collaborating with physicians who study the outcomes for patients using these sorts of products and it’s applying this clinical information to develop its products. Polite partners with Seattle’s Advanced Integrative Medical Sciences (AIMS) Institute, a healthcare clinic that incorporates conventional and naturopathic approaches.

Its medical advisory board includes AIMS Institute co-founders Dr. Sunil Aggarwal and Dr. Leanna Standish. Both also hold positions at the UW School of Medicine and Bastyr University, a school of alternative medicine in Kenmore, Wash. The company has competition. CBD products almost by definition are health-related. Other medically focused cannabis brands include Aunt Zelda’s and Mary’s Brands. But the sector does seem to give less priority to medical applications. A search on the cannabis platform Leafly, for example, doesn’t provide a clear path to finding low-dose THC-containing products for health needs.

Polite founders say their goal is to help customers discover which formulations and doses work best for meeting their health needs. That includes products to address chronic pain and inflammation, sleep, stress and anxiety, digestion and immunity, energy and focus, and joint and muscle pain.

It focuses on cannabis educational outreach to the public, healthcare workers, and “budtenders” who work in marijuana retail stores and often have only their personal experience to draw upon when recommending products.

“This issue is, forgive the pun, truly grassroots,” said Sue Tan. “You have patients going to their healthcare providers and saying, ‘I’m going to try this [cannabis product], whether you believe in it or not, because I’m out of options. Everything else has failed me.'”

While the company is engaged in research into cannabinoids, it is not conducting rigorous FDA-approved clinical trials and is not publishing studies in peer-reviewed journals. It does employ outside laboratories to test its products for ingredient concentrations and contaminants such as pesticides.

The company’s aesthetic and name are trying to walk the line of respectability — aiming to offer products that people would be comfortable providing to ailing elderly parents or leaving out on their nightstand — while not appearing intimidatingly pharmaceutical.

Polite is a brand within a parent company called Canvas Therapeutics, which has a second brand called Revida Labs. In addition to Sue and Yung Tan, who are siblings, Canvas’ other co-founders are Mary Brown Szomjassy, Jeffrey Freeman Jr., Adam Melero, Melissa Durkee, Mike Szomjassy and Suan Teo.

Prior to founding cannabis companies, Yung Tan was a corporate attorney at firms including Perkins Coie and a senior investment banker at banks such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Sue Tan has done design work internationally and co-authored a book on innovation. Brown Szomjassy has a background in education and been a consultant in cannabis health education for 14 years.

Polite’s cannabis products are available in Washington and Arizona, two of the states where recreational marijuana is legal. The hemp items are sold nationally.

The company, which has approximately 15 employees, has been bootstrapped and not received outside financial support. As it expands its national and international customer base, the team will be pursuing capital from investors, said Yung Tan.",0
"Seattle AI startup that helps professionals improve public speaking by analyzing speech raises $6M. The news: Yoodli, a Seattle startup with an AI-enabled software platform that analyzes speech to offer tips for improving communication skills, raised $6 million.

The founders: The startup was co-founded by Varun Puri, who previously worked on special projects at Google, and Esha Joshi, who worked at Apple and is currently Yoodli’s chief technology officer. The startup is a spinout from the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AI2) and the founders were honored as Young Entrepreneurs of the Year at this year’s GeekWire Awards.

The product: The platform uses natural language processing tech to provide users with a transcript and analysis on use of filler words, non-inclusive language, pacing, body language, among other actionable insights. This data is private to the user but can be sent to friends or coaches who could provide human insights. Here’s an example of Yoodli analyzing a speech by Elon Musk in 2014.


The customers: The product is used by MBA students preparing for an interview, corporate professionals getting ready for an upcoming presentation, or speech coaches who use the tech to “diagnose” the certain speech mistakes that their clients are making. The hybrid work environment coupled with The Great Resignation created more demand for the product, Puri told GeekWire.

The competitors: Philadelphia-based startup Orai also uses AI to provide speech training. There are also a variety of well-funded language processing startups, including Otter and Descript, that offer transcription services in real time. Descript, for example, underlines words such as “uh” and “um” in its transcriptions. Puri said “our biggest competition is a bathroom mirror, a stopwatch or a camera.”

The funding: The seed round brings Yoodli’s total funding to $7.1 million. The fresh cash will be used to support the startup’s product development, sales and marketing expansion. It did not share its business model or reveal its valuation but said that it is generating revenue.

The funders: The seed round was co-led by Madrona Venture Group and Cercano Management (formerly Vulcan Capital), with participation from J4 Ventures, Ascend, and other angel investors.

“The fear of public speaking has affected humanity throughout history and across cultures,” said Patrick Ennis, a partner at Madrona who will join the Yoodli Board of Directors. “At Madrona, we see the massive impact that Yoodli will have by improving communication for everyone.”",0
"Alibaba among investors as Chinese bike sharing startup Ofo raises $700 million in fresh funds. Chinese bike-sharing startup Ofo has set its sights on global expansion, saying on Thursday it raised over $700 million in a funding round that included Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.

The funding round was led by Alibaba, Hony Capital and CITIC Private Equity, with additional participation from existing investors Didi Chuxing and DST Global.

“We will further upgrade our service for better user experiences, accelerate our global expansion strategy and continue to lead the bike-sharing industry,” said Dai Wei, founder and CEO of Ofo, in a prepared statement. “Our vision is to unlock every corner of the world, and make Ofo the universal language.”

Ofo declined to disclose the valuation for the current funding round, but Dai told CNBC in April the company was worth more than $2 billion.

China’s bike-sharing industry has been heating up, with upstarts such as Ofo, rival Beijing Mobike Technology and others aiming to improve urban mobility in the country and promote greener transport.

The concept of bike-sharing is simple enough: People use a smartphone app to unlock a nearby bike and ride to their final destination for a small fee, beating the clogged traffic in many Chinese cities.

Investors have seen the potential for the market, and have poured sizable chunks of money into the segment. Before Thursday’s funding news, Ofo said it had raised more than $650 million.

Last month, Mobike said it had raised over $600 million in a funding round led by internet giant Tencent Holdings and joined by Sequoia, TPG and Hillhouse Capital among others.

By the end of the year, Ofo said it planned to deploy 20 million bikes to the bike-sharing ecosystem and to expand its services to reach 200 cities in 20 countries around the world. The company added that it currently has over 6.5 million bikes in 150 cities.",1

China could be the first in the world to start regular flights on pilotless passenger drones. Chinese startup Ehang says its autonomous passenger drones could soon be flying in the skies of China’s biggest cities, making the country one of the first in the world to roll out such a project.

Ehang announced a pilot project with the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, in which it plans to set up three or four regular flight routes for passengers to take, the company’s co-founder Derrick Xiong told CNBC on Wednesday. That could take place either this year or in 2020, Xiong said.

If that happens, China would be the first country to carry out such a program where passengers are able to travel in autonomous flying vehicles. Other places like Dubai are also looking into it, carrying out tests, but have not announced programs that resemble Guangzhou’s.

Ehang is not the only company pushing forth autonomous drones. Both Airbus and Boeing have tested their own versions of this technology in the past two years, while German startup Lilium is another player in the game.

For many of these companies, their vision is a world full of flying taxis that are able to provide a new form of urban transport, particularly in areas where traffic is a problem. Before such flying vehicles can take off, however, there are a number of challenges, from needing new infrastructure to regulatory concerns, to convincing passengers that the technology is safe.

For a start, Ehang will be working with the authorities in Guangzhou to build up infrastructure like landing and take off pads, according to Xiong. The company was recently picked by the Civil Aviation Administration of China as the country’s first company to start a pilot program for the development of autonomous passenger drones.

The startup is also working with Chinese regulators to develop an updated set of regulations to account for this new technology, as existing laws are lacking on this front. 

“We are seeing so much positive changes in the past several years,” Xiong said. “When we started from … year 2016 ... nobody even know what is this all about. So earlier this year we have this official approval from China Civil Aviation Administration basically allowing us to have this pilot program … because we are ... working together ... to build up the standard.”

But Ehang will also need to convince consumers that the flights will be completely safe. It claims that it has conducted over 2,000 test flights inside and outside of China in various weather conditions, and is confident of the safety standards.

“So we are confident to say it’s safe because you know from the ... the original design of this aircraft, its safer than most traditional aircraft. Because we have 16 propellers, 16 motors and we have this super efficient safety power redundancy system, meaning even if you … lost the motors or even several motors you’re still fine,” Xiong said.",1
"Tier Mobility lays off 180 people amid poor funding climate. Tier Mobility, the German micromobility giant that recently acquired Spin from Ford, is laying off 16% of staff, or 180 people, according to a LinkedIn post by CEO Lawrence Leuschner and an open letter from the executive that has been viewed by TechCrunch.

“Ultimately, we have to respond to the current economic and funding climate, reducing the number of projects and business lines we are focussing on as a company in order to accelerate our path to profitability,” wrote Leuschner.

Leuschner also noted that he’s committed to helping those who were laid off find new roles. Tier has set up a Tier Alumni page with details of the people who are leaving to assist recruiters. While Tier has not responded to TechCrunch’s requests for more information, the layoffs appear to span a variety of teams, mostly in Berlin, with the highest concentration of layoffs coming from marketing, market development and technology teams. Most employees were informed by team leaders in “1-2-1” meetings Tuesday morning, according to Leuschner’s letter.


Tier’s decision to cut staff is the latest in a string of tech startup layoffs that are particularly concentrated in late-stage companies that are finding the current economic climate a difficult one in which to raise extension rounds and grow into their valuations. Tier was previously valued at $2 billion.

The transportation space has not been immune to this. In June, Bird laid off 23% of its staff, or about 140 workers, due to a dire need to tighten its belt and restructure internally. Last month Lyft let go of 2% of its staff, or about 60 employees, as it shut down its in-house car rental program. And this week Ford Motor Company said it that plans to lay off 3,000 employees as it restructures toward electrification.

The news from Tier comes as the micromobility operator appeared to be on an upswing after raising $200 million in October last year and going on a startup shopping spree. Last November, Tier acquired Nextbike to double down on its commitment to offering e-bikes, as well as e-scooters. In December, the company bought Wind Mobility’s Italian unit to expand geographically. By March, Tier had acquired Fantasmo to bring the startup’s camera-based scooter parking validation technology in-house, as well as Spin from Ford, marking the operator’s entrance into the North American market and making it the largest operator in the world. All of those deals, aside from Ford, were likely primarily stock deals, meaning Tier didn’t necessarily have to shell out cash for them, according to industry experts.

“We have moved away from the strong focus we had on rapid growth and geographic expansion that defined the first few years of the business, and towards ensuring an increased return on investment for our current footprint,” wrote Leuschner in his letter to staff, noting that Tier had been transparent about three months ago with the team about the company’s goals to accelerate its response to the current economic downturn and funding climate. “We have also taken the decision to stop or pause specific projects and work streams that can’t currently demonstrate a clear path to profitability, and we have shared these decisions with you as they have been made.”

Team members who were laid off will have access to severance pay, employee support in finding their next role, including help with CV, LinkedIn and cover letter writing, access to the alumni page, mental health support for three months of leaving the business and the ability to keep all office equipment and laptops for permanent employees. Tier is also offering equity and dropping its one-year cliff on ESOP for everyone hired in the past year.


The company told TechCrunch that after assessing certain projects and directions that Tier would have to reduce or stop, it then looked at which roles would be unnecessary as a result of those decisions. To keep the process fair and retain as many people as possible, Tier applied a social scoring formula to determine where to make cuts.

“Different countries have different requirements when it comes to this but often this takes into account things like tenure, age and whether an individual has dependents,” Madeline Ash, strategic communications advisor at Tier told TechCrunch via email. “Once we had been through these two steps, we then also went through a process to skill match affected individuals against any open roles we have at Tier and Nextbike to see if these could be offered as an alternative to allow us to retain as many people as possible.”",1
"Kindred Motorworks puts a modern spin on vintage car restomods. wners of vintage cars know the deal. The “project” is never done and driving an old vehicle means dealing with mechanical failures, encroaching rust, old wiring shorting out and the continual hit to a bank account. For some, that’s part of the allure: a never-ending labor of love that includes the joy of a weekend spent replacing a starter or rewiring the brake lights.

For others though, the desire for an old vehicle — whether for sentimental, aesthetic or historical reasons — is squelched by the nonstop maintenance. For that latter group of people, there’s Kindred Motorworks, a new restomod startup based in Northern California that takes sought-after old vehicles and infuses them with new powertrains, safety features and other modern-day touches.

The restomod business isn’t really new. But Rob Howard, the CEO and founder of Kindred, which had its public debut during Monterey Car Week, says their tech-focused approach puts the startup in an entirely different lane than the competition.


Their method provides an intriguing glimpse into how today’s technology can benefit the public desire for vintage items that work better than they did when they were new.

It’s a strategy that has helped Kindred Motorworks raise more than $20 million through its first two funding rounds. It raised $5 million at the end of 2020 and another $15.6 million at the end of 2021. It has attracted a number of high-profile investors, including Hagerty, a company known for vintage vehicles and one of the country’s largest insurance providers for those vehicles, and Robert Downey, Jr.’s Footprint Coalition. Other backers include CPMG, Goldcrest and Fifth Down Capital. On the lift in Kindred’s shop is the frame of a Chevy 3100, a pickup popular with vintage vehicle enthusiasts that was in production from the late 1940s until the late 1950s. Howard says this truck has already been stripped down and rebuilt multiple times and will go through the process again and again.
According to Howard, this will lead to a very detailed step-by-step process or blueprint that will be used to rebuild 3100s with electric powertrains that will be sold to customers.
The system will include how-to videos for every step, which may seem like overkill, but will result in the vehicles being built exactly the same every time.
It will also allow employees without the deep technical know-how to jump into the build process and learn on the job. When a person clocks in, they’ll be assigned a task at a stocked station based on their experience. Most restoration shops are staffed with people who have a master mechanic-level knowledge about the vehicle and cars in general.

Those funds will support the company as it works toward full production in 2024.

The teardown and blueprint
Kindred stands out from the hundreds (potentially thousands) of shops that restore old vehicles through its standardized process that begins by handpicking a vintage car, truck or SUV and then tearing down and mapping every inch. The company then takes this blueprint and uses it for every part of the rebuild process, from parts sourcing and procurement to final assembly.

The aim is to take an arduous, long and expensive process and make it efficient, repeatable and at scale.


“I knew we could apply technology and scale to this and make it much more efficient,” Howard told TechCrunch.",1
"Pastel, a Nigerian bookkeeping and digital platform for merchants, raises $5.5M led by TLcom
There’s no end to digitizing the operations of small and medium businesses (SMBs) in the traditional retail sector across sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria alone, this industry, worth more than $200 billion, consists of over 40 million businesses of varying sizes, according to reports.

Traditional retail in the country comprises small kiosks and open-air markets selling various products from food and beverages and groceries to personal care products and stationery. B2B digital marketplace upstarts such as TradeDepot, Sabi and Omnibiz have raised millions of dollars to help thousands of these businesses purchase inventory from manufacturers while providing solutions to track cash flow, payments and access capital. Meanwhile, another group of startups provides software and apps to assist these retailers with their bookkeeping and sales tracking processes, among other features.

Pastel, a startup in the second category which has been under the radar for more than a year, is announcing a seed raise of $5.5 million led by pan-African venture capital firm TLcom Capital. Other VC firms such as Global Founders Capital (GFC), Golden Palm Investments, DFS Labs, Ulu Ventures, Plug and Play and Soma Cap also participated in the seed round. The startup raised a $620,000 pre-seed last year from some of its existing investors.

Formerly Sabi Cash, Pastel was founded by Abuzar Royesh, Olamide Oladeji and Izunna Okonkwo, Stanford graduate students who, according to co-founder and chief growth officer (CGO) Okonkwo, in an interview with TechCrunch, shared similar interests in building solutions for micro and SMBs in emerging markets, particularly from their countries of origin: Afghanistan (Royesh) and Nigeria (Oladeji and Okonkwo).

The company’s flagship product, Sabi (not to be confused with a B2B e-commerce marketplace with the same name), is a digital bookkeeping app that allows small businesses to monitor and manage their transactions and customers, get insights into their cashflows, issue receipts, and effectively manage customers who owe them.

Small businesses in Nigeria have stayed offline for years, storing information and essential data offhand, on paper or ledgers. All these inefficiencies, asides from being time-consuming, lead to errors and affects cash flow and finance, which is why nine out of 10 small businesses in the country fizzle out in the first five years. Bookkeeping solutions such as Pastel’s help these businesses streamline processes digitally and save money.

The bookkeeping and customer relationship management Pastel launched last year recorded more than 100,000 merchant sign-ups by December 2021, said Okonkwo. The free app currently has more than 45,000 active merchant users. Pastel has recently added more features for merchants to capture more value in this chain. However, unlike other platforms that have bundled several features into one app, Pastel chose a different strategy and made each product standalone: Quick Receipt and Pastel Financing.

“Our thought process was to get traction quickly by solving a merchant’s pain point with a free and easy solution. The next step was to capture value. So we added value capture features to the Sabi app that our customers love. Now we are building a lot more,” Okonkwo said about the company’s decision to build three standalone platforms instead of coupling them all into one app. “The way we’ve thought about it is, as opposed to creating a super app that a lot of other fintechs have or are in pursuit of, we are taking a more platform approach, meaning that any Pastel user can create an account with any of our apps. With the same login they can access all the other solutions that we’re providing.”

The Quick Receipt app provides businesses with simple invoicing and receipts tools and over 60,000 active merchant users. On the other hand, the Swift Money app, which leverages local saving groups called ajo in Nigeria to provide financing for businesses, has been stealthily built for the last three months through Pastel Financing.

Ajo or esusu is a popular financial scheme in Nigeria where a group of people contributes money in varying intervals to a leader who stores the cash on their behalf. They can have different purposes for engaging in this activity, such as saving toward a particular goal or accessing a large pool of credit.

The Swift Money app is designed to work with already established ajo leaders and their groups. Pastel does not aim to replace these leaders, but rather provide them with tools to better track their groups’ well-being, as well as provide financing for the group members. In addition to engaging with the formalities of cash collection and depositing cash in a [Pastel] bank account for savings, the leader downloads the app to set up profiles for members. When any of the members (which in this case are merchants) want to access loans, the leader requests on the app, the member is evaluated based on their saving history and if credit worthy, a business loan is disbursed to them.

The leader is then in charge of recollection of these loans to a pastel account similar to the way they have always done their savings collections.

Pastel only started making revenue recently and does so by charging interest and a small fee on these loans; it also has access to savings to use as a float for loan financing. The one-year-old company plans to raise debt capital by January to complement this process, Okonkwo said. “We’ve not raised debt now because we’ve not scaled out our loan product.”

The U.S.-headquartered and Lagos-based Pastel isn’t the only startup operating in this line of business. In the last 24 months, several startups across West Africa, including Kippa, Bumpa (which recently launched a social commerce integration with Meta), OZÉ and Bamba, have ventured to serve small and medium businesses with bookkeeping tools and credit. While they offer almost identical features such as handling bookkeeping, managing inventory and tracking sales, Okonkwo argues that Pastel’s product-centric approach distinguishes the company from others.

“As a team, we are taking a product-led growth approach where we iterate after doing massive amounts of research into how users are using the solutions and what they are asking for,” said the co-founder. The new capital will assist Pastel in increasing its efforts in this area as it looks to expand its product offerings and develop more productivity and finance management features and tools around group savings, loans and payments for small businesses.",0
"SoftBank-backed Socar, South Korea’s largest car-sharing startup, tumbles on market debut. Socar, South Korea’s largest car-sharing startup, tumbled in its Seoul stock market debut Monday even after pricing shares below the bottom end of a marketed range.

Shares of Socar rose 1.25% from its IPO price of 28,000 won ($21.10) in the initial minutes of the debut, before tumbling to 26,300 won and giving the firm a market cap of $642 million.

Last week, Socar cut its targeted IPO offering to 102 billion won ($78.1 million), giving the car-sharing company a valuation of 966.5 billion won ($731 million) before the start of trading.


Socar’s debut comes amid a sluggish period in the IPO market in South Korea that has prompted a series of Korean companies to delay their listing plans.

Analysts attributed the muted performance of Socar’s debut day to an expensive valuation and slowdown in the IPO market that is reeling from the global economic downturn.

Jaeuk Park, CEO of Socar, told TechCrunch earlier that the company was pushing ahead with its listing plans because it was confident in its performance and expected to generate both operating profits and net profits by the end of this year.

Rather than waiting for the stock market to recover for a higher valuation for the next two to three years, he said, the Korean mobility startup prioritized investment in organic/inorganic growth with the IPO proceeds.

“First off, Socar’s growth is faster than expected in the face of re-opening [after the COVID-19 pandemic],” Park said. “The stock market is expected to be tough for the time being, but the mobility industry will grow rapidly that we can’t miss this critical time; we will focus on accelerating mergers and acquisitions and investments in new businesses and technology.”


The company plans to beef up its services and geographic expansion efforts via acquisitions to become a mobility super-app with the goal of posting 1 trillion won ($748 million) of revenue by 2025, up from 289 billion won last year, Park continued. It aims to reach 30% or more annual revenue growth by 2025, he added.

Socar, the first and only unicorn mobility startup in South Korea, aims to become the first listed profitable unicorn company, Park noted.

Socar, backed by SoftBank, and Korean strategic investor SK Inc., entered the unicorn club with roughly 183.2 billion won ($150 million) funding at a 1.3 trillion won (approximately $1 billion) in March from Lotte Rental, the rental car unit of South Korean Lotte Group. The startup raised a total of 379.7 billion won ($ 284.2million) since its inception in 2011 before its IPO.

The company’s major shareholders, including SoftBank, SK Inc., Lotte Rental and Altos Ventures, will hold their stake since they agreed to a lock-up period of up to six months.


The 11-year-old firm, which started the car-sharing service with 100 rental cars in Jeju, now manages a fleet of more than 19,000 vehicles across the country, offering services, including car-sharing, car-hailing, electric bicycle rental, parking, vehicle management and vehicle maintenance. It will launch its transportation super-app later this year, providing all-in-one mobility services. Additionally, Socar is building an ecosystem for future mobility, including an autonomous driving platform, charging stations service for electric cars and micromobility.

Park said in an interview that Socar wants to enter the Southeast Asia market with its new business, a fleet management system (FMS) B2B SaaS service that it plans to begin selling later in the fourth quarter of this year. Socar, based on its 19,000 vehicles, has built the FMS technology that uses data, such as vehicle location and surroundings to support effective monitoring and control systems, providing accurate information to drivers and management servers.

“FMS is different from car-sharing, which has been Socar’s flagship business for the past ten years, and if stabilized, it is a B2B SaaS that guarantees a high-profit ratio,” Park said.

Socar claims that the company has captured about 80% of the market share in South Korea, with more than 11.4 million users and 1.4 million monthly active users this year.


The Korean car-hailing company has set up Socar Malaysia, a 79% stake owned by SK Inc., and launched services in Malaysia in 2018 and Indonesia in 2020.

Socar was founded in 2011 by Lee Jae-woong, who co-founded South Korea’s largest internet portal operator Daum Communications; Daum merged into Kakao in 2014. Jaeuk Park, a serial entrepreneur, who founded VCNC, an operator messaging app for couples called Between, in 2011, sold VCNC to Socar in 2018. After the sale of VCNC, Park joined as Socar’s chief strategy officer to lead Socar’s ride-hailing business Tada and took on the chief executive officer role (CEO) in 2020 after Lee stepped down.

Korean game maker Krafton acquired VCNC’s messaging app unit in May 2021, while Viva Republica, a Korean financial super app Toss operator, bought a 60% stake in Tada, the ride-hailing business of VCNC, for an undisclosed amount in October last year.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s TMap Mobility, whose investors include Uber Technologies and SK Inc.’s investment firm SK Square, said Monday it has raised $149.2 million (200 billion won) from strategic investor KB Bank. Another Korean car-hailing platform Kakao Mobility, which also had planned an IPO between 2022 and 2023, said last week it has terminated its sale talk with Korean private equity firm MBK Partners.",1
"Mobot secures capital to grow its fleet of robots that bug-test mobile apps
Mobile apps have to be bug-tested across countless devices to ensure they work as intended. Users don’t look kindly on poor experiences — 88% say they’ll abandon apps based on minor glitches, according to software testing vendor Qualitest (which admittedly has a horse in the race). Testing is a time-consuming and expensive process, with 31% of app development firms in one poll estimating expenses at between $5,000 and $10,000. And to some outfits, the highest-quality testing simply isn’t available, either due to logistics reasons or the relentless push to reach release.

Eden Full Goh hopes to change that — and to make money doing so. She’s the founder of Mobot, a startup building what Full Goh claims is the first “infrastructure-as-a-service” platform that lets developers use physical robots to automate app testing on devices. Bucking the macroeconomic trend, Mobot this week closed a $12.5 million Series A round led by Cota Capital with participation from Heavybit, Uncorrelated Ventures, Bling Capital and Primary Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total raised to $17.8 million.

Previously a product engineer at Palantir and medical device company Butterfly Network, Full Goh had the idea for Mobot after seeing what she describes as “bottlenecks” in the mobile app testing process. Most companies — her former employers included — recruit employees or third-party contractors to perform manual testing, which tends to be inefficient, costly and error-prone, she says.

“There are tools developed by companies like Applitools, Test.ai and others that leverage existing emulated testing frameworks to automate testing for mobile apps. However, the unfortunate reality is that many defects often slip through the cracks of software-based, emulated testing because it doesn’t accurately represent testing on real hardware,” Full Goh told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Presently, Mobot is not positioning ourselves as a competitor or replacement for emulators and automated testing. Rather, our goal is to replace the inevitable manual quality assurance that everyone is still having to do and will increasingly have to do as device fragmentation grows in the next five to ten years.”

It might sound novel, but robotics have been used to test mobile device software for quite some time. Tokyo-based Japan Novel Corp. once offered a robot that can simulate the process of flicking and tapping on a smartphone touchscreen over and over again. T-Mobile built a similar robot in-house, dubbed Tappy, to stress-test different phones and tablets before they went to the carrier’s outlets.

However, these types of machines tend to require a high initial investment, according to Full Goh — not to mention robotics expertise.

By contrast, Mobot abstracts the maintenance and upkeep away, letting customers set up a test case simply by recording a video on the app and device (or devices) to be tested. A customer success manager helps to develop a test flow and integrate Mobot’s analytics into dev tools like Jira, and then a fleet of robots and a library of more than 200 differnet mobile devices leveraging computer vision will execute the aforementioned test case — tapping, swiping and rotating app-running devices, as well as connecting the devices to Bluetooth peripherals, having them receive push notifications and more.

When the testing wraps up, the Mobot team records the results. Customers can view side-by-side reports using a self-service tool.

“As far as we’re aware, there are very few companies focused on physical quality assurance because the tech stack is quite different from their core proposition for web- and browser-based testing,” Full Goh said. “Our biggest competitors are actually crowdsourced and outsourced manual testing services offered by firms like Applause, Infosys and Qualitest, because manual testing is the most similar to the automated physical testing Mobot does … Mobot protects the entire mobile app customer journey, which is impacted by missed bugs — from user acquisition (e.g., deep links, registration flows, onboarding), retention and engagement (push notifications and crashes) to monetization (checkout and in-app purchases).”

Mobot claims to have run thousands of test cycles since its founding in early 2018, collecting millions of screenshots from the apps it’s tested. Early adopters include big names like Citizen and Mapbox, as well as Branch, Radar, Persona and around 45 others, according to Full Goh.

There’s some competition, like Finnish firm OptoFidelity, which provides robot-assisted testing for touch displays and infotainment systems. But Mobot doesn’t plan to stop at apps. In the next few years, the goal is to use the data that the company has collected to deliver product insights and “exploratory testing features” to customers, Full Goh says. Beyond that, Mobot is building a testing framework to evolve with technological advancements in augmented reality headsets, smartwatches and yet-to-come-to-market products like smart contact lenses.

Is robotics-based testing a scalable idea? Robots break down, after all, and Mobot is keeping its financials close to the chest for now. (Much of the company’s operations are shrouded in secrecy, ostensibly for competitive reasons; Mobot’s public website doesn’t show images of its robots.) But Full Goh gives the impression that she sincerely believes in the model, particularly as the market for peripherals like heads-up displays is poised to grow.

“In the next two to five years, software will become increasingly mobile- and connected device-centric,” Full Goh said. “We envision autonomous robot warehouses in the middle of nowhere — where real estate is affordable — filled with thousands of robots that are capable of testing any physical action that a human would do to a product: tapping, swiping, shaking a device, pressing buttons, scanning a QR code, capturing a photo, listening, speaking and more.”

In the nearer term, Mobot will use the proceeds from the latest funding round to expand its sales, marketing and engineering teams, increasing the overall headcount from 42 employees today to 50 by the end of the year. While the tech industry implements hiring freezes and workforce reductions, it helps that Mobot is a “counter-cyclical” business, Full Goh asserts. She says demand for quality assurance testing in the mobile space hasn’t waned as companies continue to ship new apps and updates to existing apps.

“There [is no] offering on the market to democratize physical testing for the everyday software engineering team that would never have the expertise to build a robot fleet themselves,” Full Goh said. “Mobot is a business-critical and cost-efficient solution to streamline a tech company’s product development process.”",0
"India’s Exponent Energy may have found the secret to 15-min rapid EV charging. Bangalore-based Exponent Energy might have come up with a way to deliver 15-minute rapid charging for electric vehicles. The startup, which just raised a $13 million Series A, relies on a combination of its proprietary battery pack and charging infrastructure to achieve such a feat.

Exponent Energy’s business model is geared toward OEMs building commercial EVs for fleet purposes. Ideally, the company works with the OEM to integrate its battery pack, or e^pack, that can then be charged quickly via Exponent’s network of chargers, or e^pumps. Earlier this month, Exponent announced its first partnership with Altigreen, an Indian electric cargo vehicle manufacturer, launching the Exponent-enabled Altigreen neEV HD, a three-wheeler that both companies say can be fully charged, from 0% to 100%, in 15 minutes.

The rub is that the battery pack only charges that quickly when it’s being charged on Exponent’s charging infrastructure — if the e^pack is being charged at a standard charging station, it’ll take about 60 minutes, according to the company. Likewise, the e^pumps don’t deliver the same rapid charge to all EVs, so the two must be scaled side-by-side. This is how Exponent hopes to monetize its energy offerings. It will earn revenue from both the sale of the battery pack to OEMs and the charging on a recurring basis, according to Arun Vinayak, Exponent’s co-founder and CEO.


For comparison, Exponent’s business model is a somewhat similar model to Gogoro, the Taiwanese company that works with OEMs to integrate its swappable batteries into their electric two-wheelers while simultaneously building out swapping stations around the country.

Aside from the monetization logic of including the battery pack and charging infrastructure as a package deal, Vinayak says it just makes sense to do so from a technology perspective.

“15-min rapid charging is a two-sided problem,” said Vinayak. “It’s not just the battery but also the charger. The e^pump delivers 600A of current to the e^pack (15x industry standard) while managing individual cell characteristics, including thermals to ensure safety, long battery life and performance consistency, even at 50 degrees Celsius. Since our technology is present on both sides, we’re able to manage the flow of energy far more efficiently, safely and rapidly.”

Building out such a network will require funds, which is where Exponent’s Series A comes in. The round, which was led by Lightspeed with participation from YourNest VC, 3one4 Capital and AdvantEdge VC, will be used to scale up the e^pump network to 100 location points in each city Exponent expands into, starting with Bengaluru and eventually making its way to New Delhi, according to Vinayak. The company also aims to deploy 2,000 Exponent-enabled vehicles as part of its partnership with Altigreen. ",1
"TrashBot uses AI to sort recyclables
There are a number of startups working to improve trash sorting with robots. AMP Robotics is near the top of the list, coupling a picker and a conveyor belt to sort materials in large, automated facilities. The technology aims to correct human shortcomings when it comes to recycling. Too often people either don’t bother to separate trash, or simply don’t understand where things go.

Founded in 2015, CleanRobotics hopes to correct the issue at the point of disposal. The Colorado firm’s flagship trashbot system uses on-board machine learning and robotic systems to sort materials from a single disposal point. It claims the machines are able to do so with roughly 90% accuracy — not perfect, but certainly better that what humans generally do.

“Recycling rules are confusing and consumers are often so confused that their recycling accuracy is less than chance, leading to highly contaminated recyclables, which no one is buying,” CEO Charles Yhap said in a release. “Our system improves material diversion from landfills, resulting in more recyclables and less waste.”

Given the on-board AI/ML, the trash sorting robot is, naturally, gathering data to help improve the sorting process. CleanRobotics notes, “The recycling bin of the future doesn’t stop there, it also generates high-quality data for waste audits, triggers fullness alerts, and features a large display for video content. And thanks to cloud connectivity, your TrashBot fleet only gets smarter over time.”

It’s easy to imagine other commerce-related data being utilized, based on the specific trash the system collects.

This week, the company announced a $4.5 million Series A led by Melco International Development Limited and featuring SOSV/HAX, Undivided VC and Longmont Evergreen Opportunity Fund. The funding will go toward CleanRobotics’ plans to produce “hundreds” of systems, in addition to those already installed in high-traffic areas like shopping malls and airports.

In particular, the company says it’s eyeing partnerships in China, Australia and Singapore. Funding will also go toward making additional hires, improving manufacturing and ramping up research and development.",0
"Motional launches autonomous Hyundai IONIQ 5s on Lyft network in Las Vegas. Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture that’s working to commercialize autonomous driving technology, has launched its new all-electric IONIQ 5-based robotaxi for driverless ride-hail operations on the Lyft network in Las Vegas. The news follows years of collaboration between the two companies in Las Vegas.

The launch of the IONIQs, which marks the turnover of Motional’s fleet of BMW-based AVs, is right on schedule. Motional and Lyft said last November that they would aim to start transporting passengers using the Hyundai vehicles in the City of Sin by the second half of 2022, with a full-scale commercial launch set for 2023.

Similar to Motional’s autonomous ride-hailing service that the company launched with Via in February, riders will not be charged for autonomous Lyft rides — the companies are mutually focused on rider feedback, said a company spokesperson. The spokesperson also noted that Motional has a permit to conduct fully driverless testing anywhere in Nevada, and that Motional and Lyft will secure the appropriate permits to start conducting commercial rides in fully driverless vehicles ahead of the launch in 2023.


The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has not responded to TechCrunch’s requests for clarification on what permits those might be, but a spokesperson from the department previously told TechCrunch the state is working on drafting new legislation around AVs. Nevada’s current legislation doesn’t make a distinction between testing or operating AVs with a human safety operator onboard or without, nor does it include specific language around commercializing robotaxi or autonomous delivery.

Motional did not share how many IONIQ 5s will be deployed in Las Vegas, but the company did say it will continue to expand its fleet over the course of 2022 as it gears up for its commercial launch next year.

Any Lyft rider in Las Vegas can request a Motional AV, according to the spokesperson. There will be two vehicle operators present in the front seats — presumably one behind the steering wheel in case a human needs to take over, and one in the passenger seat to record data and observations. The service route is focused on high-traffic and popular destinations along the Vegas strip and will only be available during daytime hours, which is fair when one considers that not many AV systems are trained to spot and avoid drunk hooligans vomiting on the street.

Customers who order a robotaxi ride can use the Lyft app to unlock the doors of the autonomous IONIQs. While inside the vehicle, riders can interact with an in-ride display that allows them to start the ride or contact customer support. Many of the features within the vehicles come from years of testing and rider feedback from over 100,000 rides over the last four years, according to Motional.

Motional has said for a time that it plans to expand to other major U.S. cities after commercially launching in Las Vegas, but the company hasn’t said which other cities it is targeting. Like 47 other companies, Motional has a permit to test its driverless technology in California, a state that has become a key battleground for companies like Cruise and Waymo. Indeed, in May, Motional began a delivery pilot with Uber Eats in Santa Monica, and in July the company expanded its autonomous testing in San Diego. However, Motional might look further afield for less competition. Late last year, Motional began increasing public road testing in its hometown of Boston, and in order to really stand out amongst the competition, putting an AV service on the icy streets of New England might be just the right challenge.",1
"John Carmack’s AGI startup raises $20M from Sequoia, Nat Friedman, Patrick Collison and others
John Carmack, the game developer who co-founded id Software and served as Oculus’s CTO, is working on a new venture — and has already attracted capital from some big names.

Carmack said Friday his new artificial general intelligence startup, called Keen Technologies (perhaps a reference to id’s “Commander Keen“), has raised $20 million in a financing round from former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Cue founder Daniel Gross. Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison, Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobi Lütke, and storied venture fund Sequoia are among those investing in the round, he said.


“This is explicitly a focusing effort for me. I could write a $20M check myself, but knowing that other people’s money is on the line engenders a greater sense of discipline and determination. I had talked about that as a possibility for a while, and I am glad Nat pushed me on it,” he said in a tweet.

AGI, short for “artificial general intelligence,” is a category of AI systems that can theoretically perform any task that a human can. That’s as opposed to AI systems today, which are designed for narrow, specific applications like generating art, driving cars, and playing video games. Some optimists believe AGI could be achieved within the next century, thanks to emerging algorithmic techniques and increasingly powerful computer hardware. Others, including the chief scientist at Carmack’s current employer, Yann LeCun, have cast doubt on the notion that AGI will ever be a reality.

For his part, Carmack seems firmly in the optimist camp. Speaking to MIT research scientist Lex Fridman on a recent podcast, he said that he believes AI will someday reach the point where it behaves akin to a human being or living creature, capable of becoming a “universal remote worker.”

“I do not believe in fast takeoffs … [but] I think that we will go from a point where we start seeing [AI-powered] things that credibly look like animals,” Carmack said. “I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence than a lot of people like to think and … There’s just that smooth spectrum of how the brain developed and cortexes and scaling of different things going on there.”

Carmack goes on to note that his interest in AGI was in part spurred by Sam Altman, who he says tried to recruit him to join OpenAI. (Altman is one of the original co-founders of OpenAI, the high-profile AI research lab based in San Francisco.) Altman, who’s previously said he expects AI to one day surpass human intelligence, has been vocal about his concerns about AGI — specifically how it might damage society if built or used incorrectly.

Carmack will still continue to consult with Meta on VR matters, but his work with the social juggernaut, he said, will consume only 20% of his time. Carmack moved to a “consulting CTO” position at Oculus in November 2019 to devote more time to researching AI.


Carmack isn’t the only storied technologist to found an ambitious AI startup recently. For roughly a year, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and founding DeepMind member Mustafa Suleyman have been building Inflection AI, a startup that seeks to translate human interactions into a language computers can understand. Former VP of research at OpenAI Dario Amodei is among the co-founders of Anthropic, which for most of 2021 and into this year has studied the behaviors of AI text-generating systems like OpenAI’s GPT-3.",0
"Helbiz reports revenue increase but dwindling cash reserves. Helbiz started out as a shared micromobility company but has since expanded to include ghost kitchens, media streaming and, most recently, a taxi service. The company reported its second-quarter earnings Monday after the bell. The startup was the first scooter operator to go public via the SPAC route, and many in the industry wish it wasn’t so after consistently meh earnings reports.

Since Helbiz’s public debut in August 2021, its earnings reports have shown a company that burns through dwindling cash reserves, doesn’t pull in enough revenue to make up for its high costs of operations and keeps pivoting away from core operations into new, and sometimes strange, business units.

While Helbiz’s revenue has increased slightly quarter over quarter and year over year, Monday’s report tells a similar story.


Before we dig into the financials, a little context. In late June, Helbiz signed a letter of intent to buy Wheels, another shared micromobility operator, by the end of the year. In the midst of this, there were multiple times when Helbiz employees in U.S. and Serbian offices had to wait for delayed payments. Sources told TechCrunch that aside from late paychecks, Helbiz is suffering from chronically late scooter shipments and a general lack of company structure.

Despite lackluster earnings, Helbiz’s stock is trading higher than its public market rival Bird, which also announced earnings today. Today, at $1.43 after hours, Helbiz is up 12.6%. That is largely attributable to Helbiz CEO Salvatore Palella’s acquisition of 252,636 shares of the company at an average price of $3 — a transaction that is valued at $757,908. Also, that number is still a far cry from the $10.92 at which Helbiz opened.

Helbiz’s Q2 2022 Financials
Helbiz closed out the second quarter with $4.4 million in revenue, which is up 46% from the same period last year and 33% from last quarter. Mobility, or shared micromobility rides, made up more than half of the second quarter’s total revenue at $2.7 million, up from $1.6 million in Q1.

Helbiz reported around 1.2 million rides in Q2, which is nearly double its Q1 rides, but only a slight increase YoY. Unlike Bird, Helbiz doesn’t appear to report the number of vehicles it has on the ground, nor its rides per vehicle per day.

The remaining $1.7 million in revenue came from “the incremental contribution from Media and Kitchen,” said Helbiz chief financial officer Giulio Profumo in a statement.


During Q3 2021, Helbiz launched Helbiz Live, a sports streaming platform that is currently showing Italy’s Series B soccer, NCAA football and basketball, and MLB games. Helbiz expects to generate $6 million during the first Series B season, some of which must have already been realized in Q2 2022.

Around the same time that Helbiz launched Live, it also introduced Helbiz Kitchen, a ghost kitchen delivery service. The company was coy about how much revenue the new service has brought in, but Kitchen apparently delivered something. Helbiz said in the first half of the year, revenue nearly doubled sequentially. Of course, doubled from zero isn’t exactly a massive achievement.

“Importantly, growth was solid in our core mobility business and we are improving margins as we bring down mobility cost of revenue,” said Profumo. “Even with our cost-control focus, we are investing effectively and efficiently in talent, advertising, marketing, and R&D to sustain our pace of expansion.”

Helbiz’s operating expenses did decrease slightly QoQ, but at $20.8 million, they nearly doubled YoY. Loss from operations was down at $16.4 million from $18 million in Q1, but Helbiz’s net loss of $19.7 million is about flat QoQ.


The company finished the quarter with $2.5 million in cash, which is up from $1 million last quarter, but way down from $21 million during the same period last year. Helbiz had to raise $10 million this quarter via a new issue of convertible notes. In July and August, Helbiz also raised another $5 million to fund its “multiple growth opportunities,” according to Profumo.

The first half of the year saw Helbiz use about $4.7 million in cash to fund its micromobility operations. The company paid $3.5 million to vehicle manufacturers as deposits for e-bikes, e-scooters and e-mopeds, vehicles that Helbiz expects to be delivered throughout the year. And while Helbiz’s acquisition of Wheels will be mainly stock, Helbiz put down a $1 million deposit to enter into the letter of intent, and invested $100,000 in operating licenses, which it has categorized as intangible assets.

“Looking forward, we will deploy more vehicles, pursue more micro-mobility licenses, and drive expansion in Asia Pacific,” said the CFO. Helbiz recently launched shared e-scooter operations in Australia and expanded its existing fleets in the U.S. and Italy.

The company provided no guidance for the third quarter or the full year.",1
"Dioseve wants to help infertile people with tech that grows egg cells. Based in Japan, biotech startup Dioseve’s ambitious goal is to grow human oocytes, or eggs, from other tissue. Its aim is to help people struggling with infertility, and it recently raised $3 million led by ANRI, with participation from Coral Capital.

Dioseve’s mission might sound like it comes out of science fiction, but it’s based on a scientific technique called induced pluripotent cells stem (iPS) cells, which was first developed in 2006.

The startup’s scientific advisor, Dr. Nobuhiko Hamazaki, a research specialist at the University of Washington, created Dioseve’s technology, called DIOLs (directly induced oocyte-like cells), which can turn iPS cells into oocytes en masse. DIOLs is currently in trials and has been published in scientific journal Nature.


The new funding will enable Dioseve to hire more people and accelerate its research and development. It aims to establish proof of concept by having mice give birth with DIOLs-produced oocytes, and recently established a new lab in Tokyo and hired an iPS specialist.

As Dr. Hamazaki explains, induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to grow all of the cells in the body. For example, other researchers are finding ways to use iPS to grow organs outside of the body, induce beta cells in the pancreas in an attempt to cure diabetes and generate neural stem cells to cure spinal injuries (iPS cells can be made from tissue like muscle or blood cells).

DIOLs creates oocyte-like cells directly from iPS cells without undergoing primordial germ cells, or the source of sperm and oocytes. It differentiates between them to find oogonia, or the precursor of oocytes and then introduces genes into the iPS cells. This means that people who are dealing with infertility can potentially use DIOLs to have offspring with their own genetic material.

Dr. Hamazaki said that in the case of mice, it usually takes 30 days to get oocytes, and that with human oocytes, it can take up to six months.

Dioseve’s CEO is Kazuma Kishida, who became interested in biotechnology when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C as a teenager. At that time, the available treatment had heavy side effects and a low response rate, so his doctor told him to wait a few years, because a new drug was being developed in the United States. After three years, Kishida got the treatment, curing his hepatitis C. “That drug really changed and contributed to the world,” he told TechCrunch. “I wanted to do something that could change the world like the new drug did.”


Kishida said Dioseve has been giving a lot of thought to the safety and ethics of DIOLs by having conversations with potential patients and science and medical ethics specialists. Right now, issues it is monitoring include the inheritance effect of the technology — can it not only produce healthy babies, but also avoid health issues in subsequent generations?

“We are really serious about ethics. We need to be very careful because this technology can be applied to the process of making a child,” said Dr. Hamazaki, adding, “we need to have a deep conversation with society to get a consensus if this is applicable, and the range we can apply this technology.”

Dioseve isn’t the only biotech startup researching ways to grow human oocytes. Others include Ivy Natal and Conception, both based in San Francisco, which are also developing ways to grow eggs from other cells. Dioseve says its competitive edge is its research progress and practicality.",0

It seems that in the Tesla-Twittersphere we’ve reached peak absurdity (although check back with me next week) with a well-known booster attempting to show the abilities of the software by asking for people to volunteer their children run in front of the vehicle. This Twitter account can be difficult to pin down as some tweets are purposely audacious, while others are serious and reflect actual beliefs. I don’t have much to say about this since anyone who follows the most basic tenets of society and uses logic understands it is wrong and ridiculous. My one thought: Perhaps, it’s time for us all to put our grown-up pants on and stop normalizing this kind of behavior.

Against that backdrop of unsafe practices, I wanted to note an important departure over at the Department of Transportation. Steven Cliff, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, plans to leave the agency in September after three months in the top job. NHTSA chief counsel Ann Carlson will take over for now. Cliff is headed over to the California Air Resources Board. The North American Bikeshare and Scooter Association released its 2021 shared micromobility state of the industry report — and it has some interesting findings.


One positive takeaway: Shared micromobility is rebounding from the pandemic, with services in at least 298 cities and 232,000 vehicles in operation, which is higher than 2019 pre-pandemic numbers. However, while the 128 million trips taken in 2021 is an improvement from 2020, people are still not riding at pre-pandemic levels.

Other findings from the report include:
• Electric-assist e-bikes thrived in 2021, with the number of trips increasing from 9.9 million to 18.8 million.
• Trips on e-scooters accounted for 49% of total trips taken on shared micromobility.
• About 37% of shared micromobility trips replaced a car trip, which has helped to offset 54 million pounds of CO2 emissions.
• 63% of riders said they used micromobility to connect to public transit

Scooting right along (plus ebikes)
If Bladerunner’s Rick Deckard rode an e-bike, it would look like the NIU SQi prototype.

Hummingbird partnered with engineering firm Prodrive to create a plant-based e-bike called the flax Hummingbird.


McKinsey released a report that shows investors have dumped $8.4 billion into shared micromobility companies. Investment in European micromobility businesses quadrupled since 2020 compared to 2018-2019, and that really may be the space to watch, considering Europe has far more dense cities than the U.S. does.

Tier launched its sixth-generation e-scooter, featuring a wider base, nicer turn signals and better suspension.

The U.K.’s Department of Transport reports weekday cycling rates have jumped 47% in the first half of 2022.

Vermont is the latest state to step in where the federal government has not and launched an e-bike incentive program. The state has $100,000 worth of funding to offer residents up to $250 for a standard rebate for income-qualifying purchasers and as much as $400 for an enhanced rebate. The amount will depend on the individual’s adjusted gross income and the price of the e-bike. It’s on a first-come, first-served basis, so act quickly if you live there!


Bike shop owners are struggling to get rid of inventory. Times sure have changed since the heady days of the pandemic when you couldn’t find a bike to buy anywhere.",1
